if you re going,LRTthe Rosetta mission in the news again asteroids aren just boring rocks via,LRTMission day Distance to target million km,LRTwelcome to twitter For all my followers MIDAS is an instrument aboard my mothership Rosetta,LRTcurrently times further from the Earth than the Earth is from the Sun,LRTwas launched years ago today Happy birthday Rosetta,LRTMission day Distance to target million km,LRTNASA just uploaded video about Rosetta and myself to youtube Check it out,LRTIt may be Friday evening but my sims engineers are still hard at work,LRTYou can find nice picture took of Mars on the DLR website please note the image is CIVA Philae ESA,LRTOne of those reasons is that my cameras don point in the same direction So if OSIRIS can see something can,LRTdon take as many pictures as OSIRIS does aboard my mothership Rosetta There are several reasons for this,LRTwould like to clarify am not carrying nuclear or other weapons or Bruce Willis do have drill though,LRTam now just million km from the comet going to land on in and getting closer all the time now,LRTll do it first though Harpooning comet NASA planning to do just that,LRTSad to see the end of Phobos Grunt she had number of instruments and teams closely related to my own We were cousins in way,LRTHappy Friday the th Earthlings Especially astronomy teacher my th follower Please say hi to

were wrongly identified as Earth threatening asteroid Today real roid flies past safely,LRTMy distance from the Earth doesn just increase because we re not traveling in straight lines Sometimes the Earth catches up little,LRTComet tails point away from the Sun because they re not caused by movement but by the solar wind radiation pressure,LRTWhen operating each Tx unit is switched on hourly

unique OS PhilaeThursday,LRTMy anchoring subsystem has harpoons to hold me down securely on the comet surface after landing PhilaeThursday,LRTMy ADS thruster can also give me small push towards the comet during descent reducing the descent time PhilaeThursday,LRTThis is because the comet is so small its gravity is very weak don want to bounce off into space back after landing PhilaeThursday,LRTUnlike landing on planet where thrusters may be used to slow down lander my thruster will push me down ONTO the comet PhilaeThursday,LRTThe first of my subsystems alphabetically is the Active Descent System or ADS which has Nitrogen gas thruster PhilaeThursday,LRTof my subsystems were built using advanced technology from crashed alien spacecraft Yes even spacecraft enjoy

Iridium but most collisions with more numerous untracked objects,LRTGround based systems track cm and larger in low Earth orbit There have been number of known collisions,LRThazardous objects and development technologies to mitigate divert,LRTbut yes natural processes erode hide evidence of impacts over time,LRTCurrently just telescopic surveys to detect potentially hazardous objects but we are identifying technologies needed to divert,LRTgt trackable diameter gt cm gt untrackable but lethal to satellites cm gt gt cm gt lt cm,LRTHow many space debris all size are in Earth Orbit now WSW,LRTDifficult to say but check out Grand Teton Fireball Some very large objects have skimmed our atmosphere,LRTCan he summarise his job in single tweet Even shorter safety security and sustainability of space systems,LRTthe part of humanity In the longer term extraterrestrial hazards such as asteroids prevail WSW,LRTWhat is Earth greatest threat from My personal opinion is that in

with our st TTE session with Helen Sharman Tune in same time tomorrow WSW,LRTOnly minute left Helen taking final few questions now WSW TTE,LRTslept well and did not recollect any dreams Now sometimes dream of being in space though,LRTDo you dream differently in space from WSW TTE,LRTEvery astronaut wants to return stay for months to make it worth the cost and risk of launching without missing people on Earth,LRTYou spent days in space if you had the opportunity to return and stay longer would you WSW from,LRTand the river snakes darkly through it all WSW TTE,LRTWhat do you see the ESA Doing ten years from now from,LRTIf reliable and cost effective ESA will hire on commercial basis ESA and other European ventures are developing rockets of their own,LRTHow will europe compete with cheaper newer private rockets WSW TTE from,LRTIon drives are not capable of this yet but if you don need fast delivery and chemical engines assist it could work TTE,LRTCould an ion drive go from LEO to Mars for delivery of Cargo Like SMA WSW from,LRTMy advice to is to make the most of opportunities for looking out of the window WSW TTE,LRTWhat advice would you give to before he goes to the ISS WSW TTE,LRTloved feeling weightless the views of Earth and space and seeing the experiments work but most of all enjoyed the crew team spirit,LRTWhat was your favourite thing about living in space WSW TTE,LRTHumans should continue to explore while minimising their impact on new places and that includes going to Mars WSW,LRTDo you think mankind should go to Mars WSW TTE,LRTFear is of the unknown My training had been good so there was no fear and claustrophobia was not an issue WSW TTE,LRTDid you ever feel scared or claustrophobic when you were on the Mir space station If so what did you do to cope,LRTHow did you feel the first time you looked back to Earth from space WSW TTE,LRTcarried out wide range of experiments from growing potato roots and protein crystals to testing new materials for spacecraft,LRTWhat activities were you involved with while you were in space WSW TTE,LRTLearning Russian was definitely the hardest part but as all the training was in Russian there was strong motivation WSW TTE,LRTWhat did you find was the most challenging part of your training WSW TTE,LRTdecided as soon as knew of the opportunity heard an advert for the job on my car radio on my way home from work in June,LRTWhen did you first decide to become an astronaut WSW TTE,LRTdid chemistry degree Required was degree in science engineering or medicine with practice at work Now you want PhD as well,LRTWhat academic qualifications did you do and which were required from WSW TTE,LRTMost food is inside packets or tubes so you don smell it but even so taste reduces Probably due to body fluid shift and mineral loss,LRTWhy does your sense of taste get worse in space from,LRTSolid state quantum processors exist though they don do much yet and there is big investment say years for something useful,LRTHow soon do you see electronics industry moving to quantum computing and beyond the electron WSW from,LRTIf leaving keep your contacts and be prepared for serious effort to get back up to speed But leaving opens the mind so it is also good,LRTDo you have any advice from your experience to support older women in tech Ie encourage to return not leave from,LRTWhat are your thoughts on the future of printable food Lab grown meat Have you tried either What did you think,LRTIon propulsion is used for some spacecraft interplanetary and for satellite orientation It is unlikely to be useful for launches,LRTCan Full Body Ion Propulsion Work from WSW,LRTUsing technical equipment and applying science in factory is similar to what astronauts do in space though the views are better,LRTHow did you make the transition from those industries to the space program from WSW,LRTknow sense of taste can change in space so which candy tastes better which worse from,LRTOnly mins until our TTE session with Helen Sharman Get your questions ready and tweet us live WSW,LRTWhat questions would you ask an ex astronaut who worked in the

which simplified set of physical rules to apply Planets are easier than people,LRTYeah but the more they re paid the more they seem to think they have all the answers and they re wrong,LRTSomething something Nice model don remember help,LRTHuh So they are Not actually on the books to head to Phobos just proposal for now,LRTPretty much If an atmosphere is collisional if you can knock one atmos molecule into another you ve got wind,LRTNot at the moment but Phobos is popular target and ll bet we ll see missions planned in the future,LRTThere isn much yet but there will be soon from New Horizons For topo need overlapping photos or limb views,LRTSorry had to delete the mosaic tweet because of bonehead mistake in the credits Will reissue it shortly,LRTOne more raw frame has shown up from hi res Charon mosaic but it contains nothing prolly pointed at space,LRTMVIC images do not get raw release treatment They haven downlinked many anyway have PR released what they have,LRTBriefing over going to start working little but am waiting for raw image release to really get to work on my post,LRThave not called in to ask question find it awkward to listen to phone audio watch NASA TV simultaneously PlutoPlutoPluto,LRTOfficial raw image page makes it hard to do that but bulk downloader works with my version,LRTYes ve seen this great work which used screen cap from NASA TV because the full res version hasn been posted,LRTOf course We are an international society Join at,LRTToday Cassini is taking snapshots of Saturn small inner moons to monitor their orbits,LRTtrying to figure out if it okay to repost Brian May stereo pics of Pluto he hasn responded Do you know,LRTHere you go courtesy of Gordan Ugarkovic,LRTThat question that the team is asking too There are nested dark regions maybe inner one is basin,LRTalmost not quite finished blog post about New Horizons raw image release while in flight Stay tuned For now going home,LRTDoesn look like ll get blog entry done today not all images from briefing are on web and no raw images to fill in with amp tired,LRTdidn get chance to ask when weekly raw pic release would start Was hoping for after press briefing but nope,LRTthat was fun even ran into Joe Palca on the way out,LRTAww miss my daughters,LRTAck it looks like the Charon image retweeted got un posted again Third time the charm hope,LRTthink that image wasn ready for prime time yet so unretweeted,LRTback To any remaining media covering New Horizons the coffee maker is up and running and brought fresh milk,LRTIt ll be in my blog post coming soon,LRTfinished with type type type now to switch to post post post,LRTThe original schedule had them kicking media out of this building at pm but now they re saying pm Tick tick tick type type type,LRTSame here,LRTChris Hersman mission systems engineer for New Horizons will update us on NH status now Follow and for detail,LRTPSA People who hassle me today will be muted or blocked,LRTArrived at APL too late for coffee service so have fired up loaned Keurig Media it in room,LRTBefore forget need to thank for defending my seat in the press briefing room so could run off to Skype to live,LRTBut for now it time to pack up and return to my hotel,LRTOkay think have been working too long and it is too late in the day for me to understand fields and particles science,LRTRalph McNutt is talking and and are not here to take notes so will have to serve,LRTBasically yes,LRTam having parallel processing problems in my brain so please just read streams,LRTJoel Achenbach asked my question so figured ask question for all you Pluto weather fans out there,LRTtweets most of the good quotes first but once in while gotta tweet one faster to keep her on her toes,LRTThanks for the primer on atmospheric escape processes,LRTBriefing over,LRTBlerg Yes,LRTStern was interrupted by Siri on somebody phone just now,LRTDoes anybody else think that those Charon chasms look little Miranda ish,LRTNo Green was talking about South Pole Aitken Basin sample return Lunar farside chance to sample moon mantle,LRTteam After Stern dissing of geology today you better put one of your geologists on panel soon vote Jeff Moore,LRToh god why you gotta ask about planetary status,LRTJim Green New Horizons is really the mission we wanted all along and we finally got it,LRTNow Randy Gladstone is telling us about atmosphere observations and are live tweeting,LRTRight now have to choose between writing blog entry about visiting before Pluto flyby and going back to visit people,LRTMaybe tomorrow will finally have time to play with awesome new Pluto pics But also have Curiosity update to write toomanyrobots,LRTFaceTime is the greatest thing ever for traveling parents,LRTBecause of the lovely weather in Maryland think will be going through two shirts day Therefore,LRTHI,LRTThank you to Sten Vermund amp all our AMA participants See you next week on PLOS Science Weds,LRTAMA WHO Code of Practice is most symbolic effort to SSA health worker retention but is nonbinding amp ineffective,LRTAMA Select students less likely to migrate improve workplace quality mandatory natl service task shifting,LRTAMA What are some ways govts in SSA are incentivizing physicians to practice med in their countries of origin,LRTAMA Yes by selecting students from rural areas amp nurturing their career primary care many return home to work,LRTAMA Would picking students stronger connections to home amp aren necessarily looking for the biggest paycheck help this problem,LRTAMA The nations that have done better to keep their professionals had improved infrastructures better health staffing amp quality control,LRTAMA Yes MEPI CONSAMS SACORE partnerships like the universities partnering Rwanda,LRTAMA Are there efforts to strengthen med programs in SSA to incentivize potential drs to stay amp complete their medical training at home,LRTAMA The US doesn train enough physicians to meet its needs amp has always relied on migration from abroad,LRTAMA Are there really lots of open positions in the US or is this just an attempt by corporations to drive wages,LRTAMA Stopping the migration of skilled health workers from SSA may not be possible but it is definitely feasible,LRTAMA look at the code amp don see how it could have helped what going to stop someone qualified from seeking higher pay abroad,LRTAMA Incentivizing early career physicians to stay and practice in SSA should be the focus,LRTAMA What can be done by govts on both sides to encourage SSA physicians to practice in their home countries,LRTLIVE PLOS Science Wed how migration of African health workers impacts global health MT,LRTAMA Most SSA migrant physicians practicing in the US were recruited here as residents then as licensed physicians,LRTAMA When you say recruited do you mean US companies hospitals are actively depriving SSA of medical care,LRTAMA Conditions of service is equally amp maybe more important as factor of migration than wage differential,LRTAMA What the avg salary compensation difference between physician

conventional methods of genetic engineering,LRTPLOS Science Weds is live on ask your questions about syntheticbiology amp programmed evolution here,LRTAMA It is conceivable that we could apply Programmed Evolution to bees or other eukaryotic organisms,LRTAMA Could we engineer bees that are resistant to disease and pesticides,LRTAMA Hard to anticipate the answers coli comes up when asked the optimal way to carry out desired metabolism,LRTPLOS Science Wednesday AMA is now live Ask your syntheticbiology qs here,LRTAMA It impossible to model coli metabolism on computer More at,LRTAMA Could the problem you are solving potentially also be solved via software on computer,LRTAMA They defined fitness as optimal production of the product gt led to optimal growth amp more product synthesis,LRTAMA How do you ensure that the introduced pathways are maintained not thrown out and even optimized,LRTAMA Its cheaper to buy directly Our research was testing if Programmed Evolution could work The answer is yes,LRTAMA If the DNA sequence isn patented would it be possible to produce moon shine like asthma medication,LRTGoing on right now on PLOS Science Wednesday AMA,LRTAMA Will this technology have any application to field such as material engineering,LRTDr Todd Eckdahl amp colleagues are taking your qs about syntheticbiology in today AMA live at pm ET,LRTAMA We hope our work will lead to cheaper production of desired products cleaning up toxins,LRTAMA What is the end goal of your research say years from now syntheticbiology,LRTAMA Programmed evolution provided set of possible genetic combos amp the bacteria determined which was optimal,LRTAMA survival is linked to expression of metabolic pathway does it the likelihood of the desired evolution,LRTAMA We did not see cells develop TetR outside the Programmed Evolution,LRTAMA What have you learned about the unpredictability of evolution,LRTAMA Do you have any ethical dilemmas interfering with the natural order of development How do you solve them,LRTToday AMA We had controls so cells didn survive unless they produced the product we wanted syntheticbiology,LRTGreat Qs for today AMA How does

better understand the internal structure of other call types in the chestnut crowned babbler,LRTAMA Where do you aim to go with this research in the future,LRTAMA This is almost certainly case of convergent evolution,LRTAMA Are the brain structures involving language similar in humans amp birds or is this convergent evolution,LRTAMA think we know too little about dinosaur vocalisations to make specific predictions,LRTAMA Do you think the environment adds noticeable element to which linguistical tools can be used between birds,LRTAMA We will begin investigating how each of these sounds are perceived with systematic playback experiments,LRTAMA This species has calls that are easy to quantify analyse amp play back in experiments,LRTAMA What specifically attracted you to this species of birds,LRTAMA Yes we know that there is some consistent variation in babbler calls across different populations,LRTAMA Have birds of the same species exhibited differences in calls akin to what one might regard as an accent,LRTOur AMA is now live Don miss your chance to ask authors your qs about animal cognition,LRTEverything you ever wanted to ask know abt how birds and other species

gravity slightly affect the length of others orbits,LRTAnother method to confirm planet candidates is Transit Timing Variation this tells us if there are multiple planets,LRTThe precise measurements RV can provide allow us to be sure that we are looking at planets and not something else,LRTSpeaking of Congrats crew,LRTWhy so many candidates waiting to be confirmed We have to be sure before planet makes the cut,LRTplanet highly eccentric orbit might pass in and out of the hab zone good time to be water bear,LRTIn San Diego this weekend So are we Come hang out with us and others from on

interview Geoff Marcy Kepler coming up in couple days get ready to get even more stoked about the mission,LRTThe Kepler hardware has won some hardware of its own big props from Popular Science and Popular Mechanics,LRTFor those of you anticipating Kepler announcements looks like the first finds will be announced in January stay tuned,LRTIs there life on planets around other stars Read story in rhyme about girl on planet hunt,LRTAlso WASP which has the distinction of being the first dying planet found it got mil yrs before SMACK right into its star,LRTMeanwhile CoRoT has discovered the first confirmed terrestrial exoplanet It one of two super Earth size planets that orbit the star,LRTOk back and the planet news has piled up For starters cross WASP off the exoplanet list looks like it actually binary star,LRTNow we ve got GIANT biggest yet planet that orbits the wrong way The universe is apparently full of bad drivers,LRTWild week for exoplanets first there was the planet train wreck discovered by Spitzer,LRTIn this case is roasting hot Jupiter with day orbit and is portly xJupiter mass planet with super eccentric orbit,LRTHAT and have people pretty excited it the first time multi planet system with one transiting planet has been discovered,LRTAnother new one HD is little bit smaller Jup masses and has pretty eccentric egg shaped orbit around its star,LRTNew planets HD is whopping Jupiter mass planet with year about days longer than Earth Massive,LRTInterviewed Greg Laughlin about planet that might serve as an extra gas tank that ll reignite its star it the top story on PlanetQuest,LRTAnybody checked out Greg Laughlin blog at oklo org It dope well written cool photos and lots of stuff to ponder,LRTAlso had some folks announce that they observed the phases of an exoplanet as it orbited in front of and then behind its host star whoa,LRTPlanetQuest isn dead We ve had few new planet additions and some interesting finds like an exoplanet in Andromeda maybe,LRTIt been quiet lately but here some big news astronomers find planets using astrometry for the first time way cool,LRTProps to everyone who came to the JPL Open House Esp the RoboDome line survivors little video from inside the dome,LRTFun fact HAT transit was also detected by an amateur astronomer in Portugal lots of people getting in on the planet hunt,LRTNew planet HAT is sub Saturn size planet orbiting in scorching day orbit,LRTIf you re in SoCal this weekend come check out the free JPL open house See cool stuff talk to scientists visit the legendary ROBODOME,LRTThat not all HD is gas giant planet with an eccentric orbit that takes it as close as Mercury to our sun and farther than Mars,LRTReply The waterworld theory is based on its orbit and models that predict lots of ice water on its surface just guess for now,LRTSo to sum up Gliese Kamino maybe Gliese Mustafar maybe Confused handy reference,LRTThe same team has also found that sister planet Gliese may actually be in its star habitable zone and could be an ocean planet,LRTThis just in Gliese is just the size of the Earth and is the smallest exoplanet yet discovered It could possibly terrestrial,LRTKepler first light images are up WOOT Check em out Let hope plenty of Earths are hiding in that starfield,LRTKepler will start collecting scientific data in few weeks so far so good,LRTThe Kepler dust cover was ejected successfully Scientists now know what kind of background noise to subtract from the science data,LRTOK scratch that last post the dust cover will be ejected in about an hour at the earliest sorry for the confusion,LRTKepler dust cover is scheduled to be ejected in about an hour at the latest,LRTGet stoked for hours of Astronomy Some cool stuff like Kepler and Spitzer webcasts or the chance get to control remote telescope,LRTThe other new planet is also in constellation Draco HD is hefty Jupiter size gas giant with an day orbit,LRTWell it been pretty quiet lately but finally we have some new planets Dra is gas giant orbiting sun size star at about AU,LRTKepler has launched Right on Everything seems to be going well so far nearly minutes into the flight,LRTThis planet was teased out of previously existing radial velocity data for HD using Bayesian analysis,LRTGas giant HD is little smaller than Jupiter with pretty eccentric orbit that averages about AU from its host star,LRTPlanet Alert Not much info on CoRoT Exo yet but it appears to be Hot Jupiter type with very close day orbit around its star,LRTInterestingly they have mean motion resonance meaning that over the same amount of time one planet makes orbits the other,LRTCouple new planets announced today HD and are gas giants that orbit at about and AU respectively eccentric orbits too,LRTDespite what you may have read the new planet is NOT confirmed to be the smallest in mass discovered it about times Earth mass,LRTHot new planet COROT Exo is the first transiting super Earth and maybe the first terrestrial planet found It about Earth size,LRTNew Super Earth discovered HD is about the size of Earth but with tiny day orbit around its star Bring the sunblock,LRTScientists using Spitzer have just seen an exoplanet with wild orbit heat up over in just over six hours Deets,LRTQuestions about exoplanets Bring em on,LRTScientists estimate the size of MOA BLG Lb to be about Earth masses still pretty small but not quite as much as was reported,LRTHeads up the Earth size planet reported yesterday was false alarm some confusion between couple of reports,LRTKepler going to watch the sky for few years looking for transiting exoplanets and letting us know just how many Earths might be nearby,LRTJust days until the launch of the Kepler mission get excited We ve got countdown and mission info at planetquest jpl nasa gov,LRTAnd the planet train keeps on rolling HD is about Jup size and has year almost as long as ours at days,LRTFirst new planet of HAT is almost Jup size with toasty day orbit located in the Cygnus constellation,LRTHD on the other hand is just over half Jupiter mass and takes just about Earth years to make its orbit we re up to now,LRTNew planets for the weekend HD is about Jup mass and take about Earth years to orbit its star,LRTOGLE TR is an even bigger closer roaster Jup size with an even tighter day orbit it no place to spend the holidays,LRTNew planets HAT is hot Jupiter type planet that about Jup size and has quick day orbit time another roaster,LRTPlanet portraits keep rolling in French astronomers managed to snap pic of planet orbiting the bright star beta Pic,LRTIts sister planet HD is bit bigger Jup size and orbits farther away AU albeit with pretty eccentric orbit,LRTAnd the planet train doesn stop HD is about the size of Jup and snuggles right up to its host star with an day orbit,LRTSo we re up to planets discovered but more importantly we finally have visible light images of exoplanets Christmas comes early,LRTAnd finally HR orbits at AU and sits about AU from its star Both HD and Fomalhaut are visible from Earth stars only,LRTHR is another big ol gas giant Jup size orbiting its star at distance of AU That makes for day long year,LRTOne of the trio of planets that was imaged HR is about Jupiter size and orbits hefty AU from its host also blue star,LRTOne of the imaged planets Fomalhaut is no bigger than Jupiter size It orbits about AU from its host young blue star,LRTHere another link with better picture of the three planets discovered from the ground,LRTAnd it doesn stop there Scientists also managed to snap pics of more from the GROUND wow Check it out,LRTHubble has snapped one of the first pictures of an exoplanet Take look here,LRTBIG exoplanet news coming up later today Stay tuned,LRTSo now we re up to planets These latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky using the radial velocity method,LRTNow this is big one HD is Jupiter size and has really odd eccentric orbit Planet or brown dwarf It not clear yet,LRTHD is Jupiter mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was Earth orbits from our Sun,LRTCorrection to the last post planet name is HD Yet another poetic exoplanet moniker,LRTHalloween planets HD is gas giant about the size of Jupiter with an orbit about as far out from its star as Mars is,LRTThat makes new planets discovered and brings our planet count to Get the fine details on these cool new worlds at,LRTHD is gas giant with super eccentric orbit if it orbited our sun it would swing from closer than Mercury to farther than Mars,LRTHD is massive planet the size of Jupiter It has very eccentric orbit that takes it days to complete,LRTHD is the size of Jupiter with an orbit of days around star just hotter than our sun about as long as Mars year,LRTBD is big ol Jupiter size planet with pretty eccentric day orbit around its small star,LRTHD is also in the constellation Scorpio is the size of Jupiter and is bit further from its star than Earth is at AU,LRTLots of new planets to announce HD is almost the size of Jupiter and orbits about half an AU from sunlike star,LRTLupus TR is back on the list new evidence shows it planet This is Jupiter size world that only AU from its star Hot,LRTLooks like Lupus TR might actually be part of multiple star and not actually planet so we re dropping it from the count for now,LRTWeird COROT exo is the size of Jupiter but its mass Scientists aren yet sure just what it actually is Link,LRTLooks like the HAT and WASP teams found the same planet at the same time So now it called HAT WASP and the count is back to,LRTThis actually just refers to extrasolar planets not in our own solar system good question,LRTFor those keeping score this brings us up to planets discovered and multi planet solar systems so far it busy neighborhood,LRTAnd HD is more than the size of Jupiter and orbits its star about as far away as Mars is from our sun,LRTLooks like today triple play for new planets HD is just about the size of Jupiter and orbits at abou AU from its star,LRTNew planet added today CT Cha crams Jup masses into planet just times as big and orbiting AU possibly brown dwarf,LRTMOA BLG was discovered using gravitational lensing an exotic way to hunt for planets using light bent by the gravity from stars,LRTNew planet for Talk Like Pirate Day Not much info yet about MOA BLG it about the size of Jupiter and AU from its star,LRTIt been busy week for planet hunters new gas giants announced and one retracted for total count of exoplanets discovered,LRTNASA has announced the Carl Sagan Fellowships in Exoplanet Exploration The stipend will be year to selected postdocs,LRTRemember to see the stats for any of these planets just visit and type in the name of the planet,LRTTW Hydrae has been dropped from the atlas due to findings that it might have been detection of stellar spots instead,LRTAnd one more HD which is about the size of Jupiter AU from its star which is just about Sun size Big planet,LRTHD was also announced it times the size of Jupiter and orbits about AU from its star which is the size of the sun,LRTAt long last we have some new planet updates GJ is about half the size of Jupiter and orbits AU from its tiny host star,LRTNew story on planetquest jpl nasa gov Backyard planet hunting Amateur astronomers join the exoplanet race,LRTNew BIG planet And is light years away times the mass of Jupiter and has day orbit See planetquest jpl nasa gov,LRTNew planet Cet is light years away times the mass of Jupiter and has day orbital period See planetquest jpl nasa gov,LRTNew planet Lyn is light years away times

at position just outside Rhea orbit,HRTcool raw image from Cassini this morning targeted at Pandora lot of stuff going on in this picture,HRTCassini is now photographing Enceladus trailing hemisphere from distance of km,HRTCassini is now at the periapsis closest approach to Saturn of Rev between the orbits of Enceladus and Tethys,HRTCassini is now pointed at Dione acquiring mosaic it ll get crescent view slightly later,HRTCassini is now crossing Saturn ring plane from south to north at position little bit inside Rhea orbit,HRTCassini optical remote sensing instruments are now pointed at Rhea leading hemisphere taking photos and spectra,HRTToday Cassini is taking snapshots of Saturn small inner moons to monitor their orbits,HRTWhen was in grad school tried to be theorist

Canup,HRTPluto is weird but not this weird It is an ice rock world big enough to generate its own geology and weather,HRTWe don know what made Pluto mountains yet that will be very fun puzzle for geologists to solve,HRTProbably Pluto is probably mostly made of water ice Water ice is stiff enough at Pluto temp to support mountains,HRTCassini is now at its closest approach to Titan of rev but Titan is far away km Cassini will take photos to look for clouds,HRTThis graphic by shows how much of Pluto was actually covered at this resolution more good frames,HRTHere my version of the Sputnik planum mosaic,HRTUpdated my Pluto data index page This will be last update til after my vacation Aug,HRTBlog entry Looking back at Pluto,HRTAt last ve finished filling out the chart The New Horizons Pluto flyby data set,HRTAha The last two missing frames have appeared,HRTmade the Pluto haze diagram metric FTFY,HRTAll their sunrises and sunsets Titan from Cassini and Pluto from New Horizons to scale,HRTThe new Charon frame in context courtesy of Gordan Ugarkovic,HRTLooks like three of the high res frames Pluto Charon got lost in the pipeline somewhere working,HRTHere are the last images needed to make that mosaic ve been hassling people about all week,HRTAre we seeing topography on edge of Pluto disk here,HRTThe raws for the mosaic of Pluto,HRTOMG they took of Hydra to make sure they didn miss it and got it in all,HRTRAWWWWWW IMAGEEESSSSSSS,HRTmeans as you go deeper in Pluto temp gets warmer pressure gets higher they offset almost exactly no likelier to melt at depth,HRTMcKinnon lower density of Pluto increases thickness of icy mantle increases geophysical likelihood there is still an internal ocean,HRTPluto spins slowly so you wouldn expect it to be oblate unless it had frozen in shape from earlier faster spin like Iapetus,HRTAnybody know where can read about phsyical properties of nitrogen ice with What about CO or CH ice,HRTMcKinnon Even at kelvins solid nitrogen can creep At depth it will be warmer It very sensitive to temperature,HRTMcKinnon Just you wait until the rest of these images come because know there going to be great stuff there,HRTStern We re reacting to these images in almost real time We re learning there is intricate interaction between geology amp climate,HRTThis my friends is why we explore and also why planetary exploration is awesome fundplanetary,HRTMcKinnon Sputnik planum ices seem to have moved and surrounded and embayed Hillary Montes just feather out onto edge of Cthulhu regio,HRTOlkin Tombaugh regio has methane nitrogen and carbon monoxide ices This is telling us something we need to understand,HRTOlkin Pluto north pole is tilted about degreees That means Pluto north pole points south of ecliptic,HRTStern You see above the dark disk of Pluto band of light that tells you that Pluto has haze in its atmosphere,HRTStern Charon occultation is basically square wave showing it has much less atmosphere than Pluto if any,HRTStern In looking more carefully at Tombaugh regio right lobe looks like much thinner deposit We believe source to be western lobe,HRTStern For next couple of months until mid September it will only be occasionally that we ll have new images to release,HRTHow the Sun makes tholin at Pluto cc,HRTHAZE LAYERS GUYS HAZE LAYERS,HRTWait you ve flown to the

from the Pluto system,HRTDawn at Ceres haze in Occator crater Some incredibly fast guest blogging work by,HRTThis new raw release of Charon is from First Look Clearly they are letting out the raw versions of images that have been press released,HRTThe two high res Pluto images released today mosaicked the Mountains of Tombaugh Regio,HRTThis is the nd raw image to be released from First Look

my husband taught my daughters to play Settlers of Catan lt,HRTIt is raining inside LAX terminal so they re sending us on an unorthodox route to baggage claim,HRTlt amazing how often turn blog post into an excuse to dig through for Voyager data,HRTPlanetary exploration always does that that why into it,HRTEach mission has its own website and they do great job explaining basic whys and hows of their missions,HRTStern We are moving to weekly releases of raw image data,HRTOMG Pluto plains look like arctic polygonal terrain,HRTBolden We have visited every planet if you want to get technical we have visited every planet and dwarf lt someone needs to tell him,HRTIn the meantime will be on at ET along with Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman,HRTNo new pics on this morning They must have shut down raw image pipeline,HRTBackground stars are very faint but they re there easy to see in long exposure images at,HRTCharon is bigger than Ceres but still good Ceres not much denser than Charon don know why so ellipsoidal,HRTPeople if tweet contains link and you have question about the tweet please try following link first to see if it answered there,HRTand send you Greetings from Pluto,HRTgoing to be on tomorrow with Alice Bowman yay talking about,HRTLatest New Horizons picture of Charon oddly familiar,HRTNice yes think this looks lot like the new Charon image,HRTThere it is New image of Charon,HRTKarl Hibbitts just told me all about the awesome MISE spectrometer being developed for the Europa mission It going to be hard to wait,HRTJust had nice chat with and have

no new images planned for release today Personally think this huge mistake,HRTNew Horizons is talking to big dish in Canberra right now downlinking another MVIC color image of Pluto amp Charon,HRTOvernight the New Horizons team should have received PEPSSI amp SWAP data plus high resolution frames across Charon,HRTAnd here is Akatsuki thanks,HRTCassini is now at apoapsis greatest distance beginning its rev day orbit of Saturn Orbital inclination is,HRTAlmost forgot My raw image page is now up to date as of Health downlink,HRTasked several people today about plans for New Horizons image releases tomorrow As of pm there were no plans for any releases tomorrow,HRTHero,HRTFirst look at Pluto and Charon baffling in very interesting and wonderful way,HRTjust came up with completely crazy idea about Pluto pointy mountains,HRTSpencer summing up the whole briefing well It baffling in very interesting and wonderful way,HRTArgh they didn answer my Charon forming impact question,HRTAll the images for the briefing are now onlne at,HRTApplause in the room that the heart is now informally named Tombaugh Regio,HRTCharon has WAY more interesting geology than any other similar sized world we ve visited,HRTkm is size of Hydra,HRTSociological note You can tell who are bona fide media in the room because they do not applaud at press briefings,HRTwish knew which website to look at for the images when they get posted betting but don know for sure,HRTFeeling little shaky Think it just too much adrenaline and not enough calories Gobbled granola bar Image press conf in minutes,HRTHammel Tech needs for outer solar system exploration miniaturization lightweight materials power power power,HRTHammel There is future for ground based and space based obs of trans Neptunian objects but want more ground truth than just NH at Pluto,HRTHammel We have every confidence that the mission will write an excellent extended mission proposal and that NASA will fund it,HRTHeidi Hammel What we re seeing here is as fantastic and amazing as what we saw in the Voyager flybys of Neptune and Uranus systems,HRTHersman we will hibernate during later mission cruise because it good for the spacecraft and it lowers mission cost,HRTHersman Everyone ve seen is smiling,HRTHersman The scientists got all the data they expected to get,HRTHersman Every indication is that the spacecraft is in great shape That bodes well for the departure phase and the KBO mission,HRTEmily Lakdawalla planetary evangelist for The Planetary Society AMA,HRTNeat phone home signal arrived min sec before exact th anniv of Mariner Mars flyby Jul UTC,HRTThere are new images on the ground from New Horizons The world will see some at press briefing today at UT ET PT,HRTToday shirt is The Long Goodbye by Dan Rule,HRTBehold Its icy visage revealed in all its glory So happy that is space enthusiast,HRTsorry didn have much time to answer questions today am doing Reddit AMA in space tomorrow at PT ET UT,HRTNew Horizons phones home after Pluto flyby,HRTSignal was received at UT ET PT,HRTIt too long for twitter to explain exactly why that probably planted child question about the extended mission was so funny,HRTBowman We didn have any autonomy rule firings and what that means in layman terms is that teh spacecraft was happy,HRTBowman Tell your children to do what you re passionate about Do something because you want to Give yourself that challenge,HRTBowman can express how feeling to have achieved childhood dream of space exploration pretty overwhelmed at this moment,HRTThe science team starts the crowd chanting Alice name Alice Well gee,HRTFountain going to make my remarks brief the science team wants to go look at their data think they would prefer drink sleep,HRTStanding ovation for Alice Bowman,HRTThe next downlink we are expecting is First Look It begins at UT ET PT and ends at UT ET PT,HRTIn the house tonight are some children who were born the day New Horizons launched They are now,HRTam not clapping for every single planet in our solar system It makes it seem like we have finished We have not,HRTam not clapping for every single planet in our solar system It makes it seem like we have finished We have not,HRTvery happy Leslie Young just told me they got PEPSSI data along with the telemetry,HRTholy crap it all worked mean

LORRI grayscale image,HRTThese may have been up for while already but just noticed that the last opnavs are on the raws page,HRTCharlene Christy It wonderful having waited all this time to finally get to see Charon,HRTShowalter We re not really finished searching for sixth moon of Pluto but if it there it really small,HRTAwwww via,HRTis now on the spacecraft pointing at Earth to PHONE HOME Signal takes hours to get here,HRTHere recording of my segment on on today,HRTChristy You start with Charlene and you take the ene off and put an on on,HRTAccording to Jim Christy the correct pronunciation is sharr rhymes with bar on like the word on,HRTAn epic panel beginning now Pluto Moon Discovery Team Jim Christy Charon Hal Weaver Nix amp Hydra Mark Showalter Kerberos,HRTMoore is recalling the Mariner approach images of Mars where scientists published about the km crater at Nix Olympica,HRTJeff Moore wouldn say Charon is as interesting as Pluto Not that there anything wrong with it Spencer It perfectly fine moon,HRTPoor geology team has been too busy talking about the images to media to sit down and study the geology,HRTSpencer is explaining how thermal segregation may explain contrast between light and dark terrains on Pluto as on Iapetus and Callisto,HRTMuch of the geology team on New Horizons were grad students together on Voyager so they like to give each other hard time,HRTJohn Spencer This part looks like Mars if you ignore the temperature and the composition and everything else,HRTAs Grunsfeld likes to say science never sleeps aside Science would like to sleep now,HRTHere are the informal names being used for dark spots suggested by public campaign organized by,HRTlot of the time that how science ideas happen someone poses question you have to think of an answer fast and there it is,HRTguess Tweet takes the place of the traditional phone call these days,HRTAtmospheric science result,HRTCathy Olkin From the ground we knew there were lot of different colors on Pluto but we never imagined anything like this,HRTHere is the MVIC color data hope pics will make it online soon Charon pole is red,HRTThe not planets all those round worlds we ve visited to scale,HRTYes Look what Churyumov Gerasimenko looked like up close can even imagine what others are like,HRTAs always there an XKCD for that,HRTthink that the most dangerous possible thing to say about Pluto flyby that with it we re somehow done with the solar system We re not,HRTWord,HRTOh this don agree with How about the whole rest of the Kuiper belt Eris Makemake Haumea Sedna Orcus,HRTBonnie Buratti We have been monitoring from Earth what we now know is the heart on Pluto for years,HRTBagenal Pluto looked remarkably like Mars Much better than Mars though,HRTFran Bagenal says it unlikely New Horizons will reach interstellar space it going slower than Voyagers,HRTJust had an opportunity to congratulate Marc Buie on the quality of his pre New Horizons Hubble maps of Pluto,HRTRosetta looked at Pluto too,HRTNew Horizons best look at Pluto before close approach,HRTFound the full res am working on posting it,HRTBowman We were seconds early Stern Our nav predicts came out to km closer to Pluto than aimpoint Well within spec PlutoFlyby,HRTRight now all images are being returned with JPEG like lossy compression We will get lossless ones eventually,HRTStern To my eye these pictures show younger surface on Pluto and much older and more battered surface on Charon PlutoFlyby,HRTGrunsfeld to Bowman What is the actual data rate think it lower than Bowman Yeah we wish it was PlutoFlyby,HRTasked if the new image showed evidence of hazes or clouds Stern replied he looked and hadn seen those or plumes yet,HRTXKCD What if What if New Horizons hit my car,HRTAs sitting in front row lot of photographers are shooting over my laptop with Pluto image on it to desk Stern amp Bowman,HRTThere is lot of applause happening but it feels premature until we hear from New Horizons again,HRTSince it FAQ It will be hours until we hear from New Horizons because spacecraft is too busy scienceing to talk to us right now,HRTPress briefing coming up momentarily But still hours until we find out whether New Horizons survived flyby or not,HRTClosest approach PlutoFlyby,HRTThey are playing The Final Countdown,HRTNo there is not,HRTThis is happening outside the press room and off NASA TV and not sure why,HRTBowman We had lot of activity in the mission operations center last night with DSN antennas uplinking to New Horizons am,HRTMission Operations Manager Alice Bowman getting prepped for her TV appearance,HRTMy first impressions of this image there are so many different things happening on this world,HRTMy shirt for today is Explore Planet Pluto Classic from Astro Gear,HRTwill do my best to answer questions today but lot of your questions are answered in this blog post,HRTThe next expected downlink is the PHONE HOME It begins at PT ET UT and ends at PT ET UT,HRTFour dishes in two locations at the Deep Space Network are uplinking radio signals to right niw,HRTSee that squiggle below NHPC That represents the slow trickle of bits that ll build our best ever image of Pluto,HRTAmy Barr and Geoff Collins paper about predictions for Pluto interior structures and surface geology via,HRTThe next downlink called HEALTH starts at PT ET UT and ends at PT ET UT,HRTOMG you guys this capella science New Horizons video is awesome via,HRThave been told that the wow wow color image is supposed to come out at tomorrow morning briefing too,HRTYay is here to tell us what wow wow means,HRTChoice of target will be made in August think Course correction in November Extended mission approval in,HRTIt should hit the ground at EDT but no idea how long it will take for public release predict morning,HRTNo One more Charon image as good as what we ve got one Pluto that is WAY better should be coming down tonight,HRTMcNutt Atmospheric escape rate will tell us something about how this planet has evolved in the last billion years we think maybe,HRTPluto hat Another newhorizonsbingo square,HRTPluto minus day Very first New Horizons Pluto encounter science results Pluto diameter composition atmosphere,HRTStern These first compositional measurements show us that the polar regions are compositionally very different from the dark regions,HRTStern People love turning little dots little points of light into planets and writing new textbooks from scratch,HRTStern There no single reason people love Pluto There lot of different reasons,HRTGrunsfeld Pluto is capstone of our solar system exploration and also it opening up new realm,HRTStern explains color data is much more expensive in terms of bits to get it to the ground which is why more LORRI pics have come down,HRTCathy Olkin promises new color images tomorrow,HRTStern New Horizons cruise is not record Rosetta set record But Rosetta had many flybys so didn seem like interminable road trip,HRTStern SDC hears all the thruster findings so we have to change the squelch level so we quiet down the racket from the thrusters,HRTEris is bright and super far away hence cold When it is much closer to the Sun it prob has Pluto like atmosphere,HRTStern We tested techniques we used to determine Pluto diameter on Charon and got the right answer radius km,HRTYes let,HRTunderstand you have to put miles on graphics for Americans but for love of Pete why can you also put metric measurements,HRTStern We detected escaping nitrogen before expected Either escaping faster than we thought or mechanism is different than thought,HRTStern Pluto radius is km It settles the debate about the largest object in the Kuiper belt,HRTPSA will not respond to any questions comments about Pluto planetary status That is least interesting thing to discuss at PlutoFlyby,HRTThey re simulating Pluto temperatures in press room and shivering but if put on jacket will cover my awesome shirt spacegeekprobs,HRTSchenk there lot of speculation flying around team right now but we recognize most of it as being ephemeral

magic trick Over the past yrs we slowly replaced grass with native planets Which look better Go us notactuallystinky,HRTAnd of course years ago Eris was Xena Makemake was Easterbunny Haumea was Santa It took me long time to start using the real names,HRTHaumea was announced yrs ago yesterday fastest spinning large body in solar system Multiple moons Family of collisional fragments Wow,HRTMakemake was announced on the same day as Eris years ago Surface is covered in slabs of methane Awesome place Let go,HRTThings we ve learned If Eris had been at its closest point to the sun Clyde Tombaugh would likely have discovered it yrs ago,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs its surface reflects almost of the sunlight that hits it because of that frozen atmosphere,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs its orbit is inclined by degrees to the plane of the planets Which still doesn make sense,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has satellite Dysnomia that we think was formed in giant impact Maybe,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs it is much more massive than Pluto yet tiny bit smaller thus much rockier on the inside,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has very Pluto like surface composition though at the distance the atmosphere is frozen,HRTyrs ago today Lilah was days old And we announced the discovery of Eris Lilah was not pleased that was gone all day Sorry Lilah,HRTPeople will continue ground based observations of the atmosphere over the next years and would bet it is still there mostly the same,HRThate to be the voice of Pluto sobriety or any sobriety but that whole Pluto atmosphere has collapsed in year thing smells fishy,HRTYay More Charon My current explanation huh,HRTSo are the mountains and the big ice mound somehow related Not obvious how But Hmmmm Or perhaps just seeing things Again,HRTAlso interesting to me in the full Pluto image don think see anymore spiky mountains like the ones in the SW of Tombaugh,HRTAnybody else think the two big craters on the left are from the impact of near contact binary KBO,HRTOther places likely to have cool CH flows Makemake Eris Quaoar OR Fun to see Pluto to better understand these too,HRTIn my view the ice flows are the coolest things found on Pluto so far Still want more Charon though,HRTSounds like people have water on Mars style press release fatigue Hard to blame them really,HRTJust interview by BBC presenter about Kepler who said look haven we more or less heard all of this before And um yeah kinda,HRTAs mentioned earlier today this is thoroughly awesome On reflection it remains awesome,HRTlove to see more of that dark terrain on Pluto THAT where we ll learn whether or not there is internal activity think Soon Ish,HRTAh Plenty of craters on Pluto where they re not covered by ices Which is of course what was expected all along,HRTHaze in the craters of Ceres OK That counts as awesome,HRTHappy to see my favorite wikipedia dwarf planet image updated so quickly,HRTOK Pluto That was fun Now back to work Today Europa Trojan asteroids And super secret project with the code name Phattie,HRTAwesomeness,HRTIt ice volcanoes all the way down,HRTthink we have winner,HRTSo what good word for frost moving around on surface to distinguish from geological activity My brain is failing to get one,HRTAlso worth noting that geologically active generally means interior rumblings Clearly frosts move around on Pluto surface,HRTMost are also hoping that Pluto is active just want better evidence If it true we ll know soon Also if not,HRTIn current hallway conversations with planetary scientists most are unconvinced by the evidence that Pluto is geologically active,HRTBBC Newsday Right Now,HRTwife opens wines pours me glass thanks honey,HRTok hard to argue with this one,HRTSure it OK to grandfather Pluto in as planet Also you can grandfather the Earth as flat too if that makes you feel better,HRTll be there at the Planetary Society thing tonight listening for the NH signal Come say hi Throw ice or something,HRTIf you re local amp looking for place to geek out on Pluto tonight come to the Planetary Society event in Pasadena,HRTEvery time someone says Pluto looks really interesting thus should be planet Titan sheds an alkane tear,HRTOr maybe not Figuring out if that is plausible requires getting out the pencil and doing calculations Which too sleepy to do now,HRTequatorial ice melting decades earlier Once it starts it spreads around the equator Leaving the heart for last,HRTIs it coincidence that the heart is on the anti Charon side Maybe light from Charon provided just enough extra heat to start the,HRTMy best is that if you came back in years the heart would be gone which sounds kind of sad and dark regions would extend further,HRTBUT the bright patch really shouldnt be at the equator That one of the warmest spots The rest of the equator is ice free as expected,HRTNot surprising to have ice patches coming and going Pluto goes through seasonal temperature extremes so that is expected,HRTThat heart on Pluto sure is odd It appears to be thick ice patch that is being slowing eaten away at the edges,HRTSo apparently my autocorrexts changes autocorrexts to autocorrexts Automatically,HRTAlso the dark patch at Charon north pole definitely looks more interesting than initially gave it credit for,HRTWatch Charon probably the most similar thing in the solar system to Orcus at least on the surface,HRTOhhh crater rays on Charon Awesome And might the tiny white splotches be my ice volcanoes want ice volcanoes,HRTUseful to keep in mind Pluto size and density in the context of other objects from the Kuiper belt,HRTHey so is it too early to suggest that the big heart on Pluto whatever it turns out to be be named Tombaugh,HRTBack in offered these thoughts on the critical question of whether Eris or Pluto is bigger on,HRTOdd that Eris is tiny bit smaller than Pluto but so much more massive They are quite different bodies in many ways Maybe we should go,HRTgood sign would be that Charon pole is not just darker but also red think we ll get color info soon,HRTPluto still pretty inscrutable at this distance More resolution please oh you will thanks,HRTendorse,HRTmonth ago suggested Charon would look like Uranus moon Ariel Similarities pretty good so far,HRTYay got my Charon craters Now where are my ice flow plains,HRTWe re approaching the summer solstice after which most of the northern ices might have headed south Process already starting now,HRTIn the fig the solid line shows the latitude of the sun time the dark regions show where the ice has evaporated white is ice,HRTHere figure from that Hansen amp Paige paper showing how Pluto surface ices move around with time,HRTEven now that about all can say Amazing how fast this is all going to come and go and how much we will wish we saw but didn,HRTOn Charon the brightest spots are likely to be ammonia rich water ice flows Dark spots not dark just lack of water flows,HRTOK what about Charon Still too low detail want craters damnit And want them now But will have to wait,HRTConclusions even at this range it is really really hard to learn details of what is going on here Recommendation Go closer,HRTof that sort Your eye is good at playing tricks on you suspect that on the nicely imaged side you ll see no giant polygons,HRTWhat are the polygonal features Not polygons Seems unlikely any physical process could form large scale linear features cont,HRTevaporating and going poleward Come back in years and it might look just like the equator Again nicely modeled in Hansen amp Paige,HRTNorth of the dark equator are the patchy tropics Summer has started here recently so suspect this is where ice is currently cont,HRTStill weird that it is at equator Maybe something interesting going on there Keep your eye out,HRTThe heart could just be random feedback It bright so reflects sunlight so cold so gets icy gets brighter gets colder etc,HRTWhy is the dark equatorial band not continuous No clue The heart looks like the brightest spot on the surface and its equatorial,HRTdark substrate behind Dark substrate is probably tholins Tholins organic muck sorry,HRTby Hansen and Paige who showed how nitrogen evaporates from the warm equatorial regions and reaccumulates at the poles leaving cont,HRTThe dominant feature on Pluto is the dark but not quite continuous equatorial band This was nicely explained in in paper cont,HRTOK friends the Pluto and Charon images are good enough for new round of speculation Let start here,HRTdo another round of Pluto image speculation but soon we reach the intersection of speculation and information ll wait Just little,HRTThe latest Pluto images remind me of early adaptive optics images of Titan totally cool and thoroughly uninterpretable Soon though Soon,HRTJust back from vacation What all of this Pluto stuff everyone is talking about,HRTBiggest Pluto surprise to me so far is that New Horizons still hasn spotted any new moons have bet yes,HRTso far nothing on pluto Charon to be surprised about But images are quickly getting better Stay tuned,HRTCharon looks grayer because it too small to keep nitrogen or methane from escaping so only has old water ice on its surface,HRTpeach relatively fresh methane starting to degrade Dark old warm ice free degraded methane,HRTon Pluto darker spots get warmer drove off ices get warmer still drive off more ices etc etc So white cold nitrogen ice,HRTmethane breaks apart and turns reddish when exposed to sunlight and space Pluto is patchy probably because of feedback,HRTTime for your periodic Pluto speculations So far all is as expected Pluto is peach colored because of methane,HRTcouldn capture good pic of Jupiter Venus so present to you Diane boat deck full moon beer Gouda,HRTMy kind of school Quaoar and Weywot at school play in Caracas Venezuela Dwarf planets everywhere,HRTThe Tour de France passes right by our mooring here in Gouda And their wheels shall become cheese,HRTAnswer very,HRTHappy AsteroidDay day on which you should ponder just how full of crap the people are who are trying to scare you about asteroids,HRTAgainst all odds this is simply an ice cream store amsterdam,HRTFun way to start vacation evacuation of LAX terminal for smoking bag Which then explodes NoSmokingArea,HRTlove what do But even more love vacation with my family Which starts now bye,HRTPluto likely mottled because of surface feedback slightly darker areas get warmer drive off ices get darker get warmer get darker,HRTWhy is Pluto so mottled looking Deconvolution will make it appear more so than it really is but we know that it really IS,HRTWhy don we see such ice on Pluto Likely there just covered in CH CO frosts amp might be morphologically similar under the frost,HRTWhere do ice flows on Charon come from The ancient interior ocean now frozen out but once erupting onto the surface,HRTDark polar cap on Charon Unlikely to be dark ice frost cap but rather lack of bright stuff What is bright stuff Ice flows,HRTNow with that first go read this and then let do some idle speculation,HRTPro tip for New Horizons images of Pluto amp Charon be wary of sharpened and deconvolved images Don believe stuff unless in raw ones,HRTSpent Fathers day telling Lilah stories about my dad His most frequent lesson Don Cut the Goddamned Corners still try to not,HRTQuaoar Named after the Tongva tribe creation deity who sang and danced the world into existence lt Quaoar,HRTAll lectures have been lectured exams examined grades graded Summer starts now My summer fun DATA,HRTIn case you were worried actually like the real non planet Pluto,HRTApparently there are those looking at you Carolina who think there should be MUSTARD in pulled pork sauce These people must be stopped,HRTICYMI my speculations yesterday on the latest Pluto images have been Storyfyed,HRTthe water ammonia would have erupted out onto the surface making it look perhaps like Ariel the satellite of Uranus That my bet,HRTTruth is more excited to see Charon suspect it will look something like this,HRTthink we ve got some polar caps as expected The dark areas South at longitude look like the expected organic rich spots,HRTFirst step read little of what we think is on Pluto Even in we had some ideas start around Figure,HRTnot involved in New Horizons so am free to do purely speculative geological interpretaiton starting NOW,HRTAs of today the silly term Plutoid has been used in precisely zero titles or abstracts of refereed papers,HRTOh my God They are so married And none of us is going to jail,HRTWhen their relationship started Kyle and Christopher never imagined that day would come that they could be married Today we made it so,HRTAnd now they re married,HRTIt almost wedding time,HRTve heard of the dark run but this is ridiculous,HRTAchievement unlocked waited in line hrs at the DMV Got to the counter Computers instantly crashed Told to come back tomorrow FTW,HRTactually spotted this one first Came running in my office Said hey come look at this So did,HRTHold still Europa You re being analyzed this won hurt bit,HRTDear Europa we are about to spy on you We will learn your secrets We are like the NSA of the Jupiter system xoxoxo,HRTNASA might go to Europa within the next decade Me amp the Keck telescope are going there in about hours,HRTComing again in in case you missed Science of the Solar System,HRTScoop all of the good results from telescopes right here on earth in the next decade before the spacecraft gets there,HRTSad that none of the instruments on which was team member were selected to go to Europa But we will do what we always do,HRTEvery time someone says dwarf planet must be planet because of the name seahorse somewhere sheds salty tear,HRTAnother view The iron is almost mirror like Olive deep green translucent This one was gift from my class,HRTMy fav thinly sliced pallasite translucent olivine Hard to photograph,HRTBeautiful Widmanstatten pattern in this iron meteorite Pattern only forms in frozen cores of mini worlds,HRTThe core mantle boundary of shattered mini world Thanks mini world Sorry about the shattering pallasite,HRTIt chondrules all the way down AKA tiny chunk from the birth of the solar system,HRTThis is an awesome Fukang pallasite Huge olivine crystals,HRTThis No big deal it just PIECE OF THE MOON,HRTNeed to record new SciSolSys lecture today because that damned keeps finding new things on Mars Stop it already,HRTAlso everyone loves those really bright spots on Ceres think these are little more intriguing,HRTOK so the white spots on Ceres are dramatic and mysterious but check out all of those near global scale ridges too,HRTOur biggest sweetest orangest cat has passed Our home is sadder and emptier Also less orange So long Ike,HRTBut the estimate was still wrong The real mass of Pluto is only th of the Earth,HRTIn when the estimated mass of Pluto was revised down to only th of the Earth it was call disappointment,HRTSorry mean all going smoothly at Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea here tonight Spectacular place to be spying on the universe,HRTzong just found this thing that helps you stay awake at night its called coffee my friends and ill sell you some for one zillion dollars,HRTIt been interesting being here on the big Island listening to people about Mauna Kea The NYT is nicely balanced,HRTOne hour until sunset on Mauna Kea Then we ll open up the Keck telescope and begin to understand the solar system little bit better,HRTNice byproduct of observing Europa with Keck is this sweet little image of Jupiter in the guide camera,HRTapparently trying to stay up all night at the telescope and having food poisoning are not things that go well together who knew,HRTAMA on Reddit minutes,HRTAnyone around Penn State next Tuesday Wanna talk outer solar system Of course you do,HRThave something on my weeks long to do list that says Deal Europa What does that even mean also have Read all of the emails,HRTdoing Reddit AMA on Saturday So you can ask me anything Really Anything at all Wide open Just not about Pluto OK Deal Promise,HRThave theory that using ice from the dark trailing side of Europa would result in the best gin amp tonic ever like to test that idea,HRTin,HRTThis sounds like it might be really good deal to me Wonder if it ever goes on sale though,HRTjust found this in the acknowledgements in paper wrote decade ago and LOLed out loud,HRTLilah was doing tessellations in math today and was all like let me introduce you to Escher and she was all like head explodes,HRTIt took total of minutes to file tax extension can now procrastinate for more months Where the ALMA proposal extension form,HRTThis Pluto musical almost makes me feel sad for Pluto But Nahhhhhh,HRTGalileo hacked my data Claimed credit,HRTApparently Vikings DIDN wear hats with horns The things you learn teaching class about the solar system,HRTThe discussion forums on my online class are diverse Mars sure but also Emily Dickinson and whether Vikings wore pointy hats SciSolSys,HRTIn moment have been waiting for for years began reading Fellowship of the Ring to Lilah last night Finished in,HRTMars is now dead to me just finished recording all of my Mars lectures so have no more to do Mars is actually dead to me,HRTJust submitted telescope proposal with title search for planets in the distant solar system Don tell anyone though it secret,HRTLilah Sigh miss kindergarten Me What part It was just fun weary sigh How come no one told me it was the best time of life,HRTyrs ago we had just recently discovered Haumea and Eris and then came Makemake Plus my wife was months pregnant It was busy tune,HRTAnyone wonder why all of those bright dwarf planets were discovered yrs ago and nothing much since explain,HRTyrs ago today we discovered Makemake the nd brightest KBO after Pluto It was unsurprisingly nicknamed Easterbunny for awhile,HRTMy free online Science of the Solar System has now begun Students from every continent except Antarctica Anyone there like planets,HRTInterested in Science of the Solar System class but logging in to Coursera is too much work Check out the intro here,HRTMy free online class Science of the Solar System is now LIVE on Courera SciSolSys,HRTWhat The sneak preview to Science of the Solar System drops tomorrow You never heard it from me,HRTlike life on an ocean plate PacificPlateRules NorthAmrericanPlateDrools,HRTWe crossed the San Andreas

aka Tongva Tribe,HRTBeautiful night up here on Mauna Kea is coming to an end ll be going home with very large bucket full of photons,HRTMauna Kea full of snow But the skies are clear the sun is setting and we re off to discover things,HRTMy mother is in Iceland this week on aurora photography trip So she took this picture Nice timing mom,HRTGoal tomorrow night Discover new never before seen members of the Kuiper belt Then kill them Wait No That not it,HRTIt beautiful and dark up here on Mauna Kea on the night before our Subaru run Snow on the ground stars in the sky sleepy in my head,HRTTon of snow on Mauna Kew but clear skies above the telwscopes yay,HRTHere the talk summary Ceres is weird So Bethany Ehlmann and pointed telescope at it Which showed that Ceres is weird Seriously,HRTBlue shirt Greens screen Yup it Science of the Soar System recording washed the shirt since last year,HRTnot saying that Science of the Solar System is the best physical science MOOC on the planet but these guys do,HRTOnly weeks until the start of my free online Science of the Solar System MOOC,HRTFlying home from Hawaii today Back again in days Because it worth hours on plane to spend the weekend with my family,HRTSo much snow on Mauna Kew that telescope crews had to hike the last bit to the summit just to keep instruments full of coolant SkiHawaii,HRTMikebrown is eccentric oddly inclined and not very bright The asteroid mean Mikebrown Also capable of destroying humanity,HRTHey Chicago on Chicago Tonight talking dwarf planets Tonight In Chicago,HRTLooks like in honor of my dwarf planets talk tomorrow night at Chicago decorated the city with solidified volatiles Tnx,HRTOK sorry for the KavliPrizeLecture bombardment but this is going to be the coolest talk ve ever given So really go,HRTOn Titan it only seems to rain hard couple of times decade Which makes it like California only colder And with methane,HRTToo sleepy to tweet it last night but as seen from Keck Titan weather report Yesterday partly cloudy little chance of methane rain,HRTThe answer to Europa hydrogen peroxide is its complicated Which means we re going to have some serious analysis to do,HRTEuropa question for tonight where exactly is all of that hydrogen peroxide coming from We might know the answer in about an hour,HRTdon wanna jinx myself or anything but we found tiny tiny hole in the fog and clouds and are looking at Europa with Keck RIGHT NOW,HRTOn scale of hopeless to pathetic how do you think my chances of opening the Keck telescope tonight look,HRTMe on Ceres The images now are just at that intriguing resolution that lets you make stuff up,HRTCeres and Pluto may become planets again soon Also this just in pigs soon to fly and something about monkeys too,HRTSo this morning she asked me if each baby is different and had the dad genes and the mom how do you get identical twins,HRTLilah after getting genetics lectures when asking last night how are babies made thought all night about one puzzling part,HRTMe It just little like kissing OH That totally makes sense Now tell me more about cells and genes and how they work FTW,HRTout of boys genes out of girls but how do the boy and girl cells get together so that they can share,HRTLilah just now How do you make babies Me Boys amp girls have cells designed to merge and share the genes together and baby grows,HRTAnd because know you want to know here is the real Sci of the Solar Sys course page With fun preview video,HRTNot bragging or anything yes yes am but SciSolSys is the top rated physical science MOOC IN THE KNOWN UNIVERSE,HRTHey In weeks my free online Science of the Solar System class starts again Last year reviews SciSolSys,HRTEver heard that the IAU def of planet says exoplanets can be planets Proof that the person never read Res,HRTBecause everyone sitting next to me on airplanes always asks the Economist explains well why Pluto isn planet,HRTyears ago today the st object in the Kuiper belt was found We mistakenly thought it planet at st but now know its more interesting,HRTValentine dinner Nerd style Oysters in liquid nitrogen,HRTRoses are red Violets are blue Which means got the wrong flowers again Damnit,HRTRoses are red Violets are blue Which is weird cause Shouldn they be violet right,HRTWorking on my March Adler planetarium dwarf planet palooza You should go or you ll likely regret it for eternity,HRTBest sight from Palomar Obs last night Ganymede slowly covering Europa seen at HST resolution Data are complicated but pix someday,HRTOpening the dome at Palomar Skies are clear Trying to be quiet so as not to spook the whales on Europa,HRTIt might or might not be true that like the bike rides at Palomar as much as the telescopes itstrue,HRTSadly that beautiful blue sky in the pic has turned to fog Current status no Europa AstroWhining,HRTHeaded to Palomar Observatory for couple of nights of searching for salt on Europa Now if those pesky clouds on Earth would st clear,HRTAlso Mars shares beer yayMars,HRTIf Mars images look blurry tomorrow its because most of the Curiosity team is outside my office drinking beer,HRTJames the Giant Peach and measles,HRTHeading home after fun planetarium show meeting Wearing Space Invaders socks just in case,HRTheaded to meeting about planetarium show Thus the alien abduction socks seemed like good idea,HRTAlso MANY CELEBRITIES who you like to watch on TELEVISION or ok on Netflix might now be getting WET,HRTdon understand the freakout on the east coast It is RAINING in California RIGHT NOW people just got WET raindropmageddon,HRTjust did BBC interview about New Horizons Which is kinda like interviewing John Wilkes Booth about the Gettysburg Address think,HRTAlso my Adler presentation will be magically simul dome cast in Peoria In case Chicago is not your kind of town,HRTHey Chicagoans giving combo talk planetarium presentation at the Adler Planetarium on March th Be there,HRTEvery time standing weekly telecon is permanently canceled an angel gets its wings,HRTAsked good kid microscope Here Lilah find it top notch Bonus it isn pink Good for plumbers too,HRTHad home plumbing problem last night Diagnosed with Lilah microscope All kids should have microscopes Because all homes have plumbing,HRTAn article in the NYT in which my graduate students roll on the floor and laugh at me Again,HRTAlso kinda sad that nobody commented on my zombie socks all day Attn,HRTTo get to Haumea you go sunward st because you go FAST when by the sun then fire your engines and then Oberth,HRTThe cool part is that Haumea and Makemake are relatively close to each other so you could send tiny sub probe to visit Makemake too,HRTsad to say

one of the white trays on the rover deck and will come get you MSL,HRTMT,HRTWatching ve learned that science consists mostly of driving around shooting things with lasers canibeascientisttoo,HRTFF People who can save me from,HRTHEY MT SCIENCE is what you do when you want the truth about thing that too dumb inanimate imaginary to tell you,HRTDid you know was born in volcano Basalts like me

waving if could,HRTGood morning from Bradbury Landing text vid standtall,HRTdon think directly in path anymore And the best part think might even be out of laser range,HRTThe rover is now parked short distance away It looks like it backed up after turning didn see was busy cowering at the time,HRTTwo near misses and now MUCH more familiar with wheels than EVER wanted to be But okay Woo hoo,HRTThat was really close,HRTlt dust settles gt lt peeks gt is it over,HRTlt rumble gt lt crunch gt,HRTOne of the wheels is coming right toward me feel so small and helpless,HRTThe wheels are
