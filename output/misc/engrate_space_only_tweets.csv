Today mission day some million kms to the comet left and about AU from the Sun now
My two Lead Scientists and all Rosetta PIs are meeting to discuss the trajectories at the comet Things start to get real
Days ago Rosetta and celebrated our th year flying in space We started our long journey on almost there now
Farewell who created amp ran this account for the past few years Best of luck from me amp the operations team
Mission day Distance to target million km You re now times further from the Sun than am from my destination
But those are nothing compared to our Mars swingby of just km above the surface
In we surprised some astronomers who mistook us for an asteroid passing by at km Then in we flew past again at km
On Friday asteroid DA will pass km above Earth surface In Rosetta and flew past at less than km
Do you ever wonder why going to land on frozen icy comet hundreds of millions of miles from home
aww shucks Thanks celebrating my name day
nice article by explaining questions my instrument COSAC will be trying to answer about the origins of life
Rosetta and have reached our peak distance from the Earth million km over times further than the Sun
Mission day Distance to target million km
Mission day Distance to target million km You re now times further from the Sun than am from my destination
From me too WSW Happy World Space Week everyone th October
My mothership Rosetta and have now reached the top of our SpaceRollerCoaster km from the Sun Now we start getting closer
My orbit around the Sun is like being on roller coaster As get higher slow down then plunge down getting faster amp faster
Comet ISON is heading in from the orbit of Jupiter which is roughly where am now It ll be huge just before reach my target wasntme
new comet has been discovered and looks like it going to be biggie possibly as bright as the moon
have some very special announcements to make in the next few weeks Can reach followers before do SpaceRollercoaster
Did mention ve reached the orbit of Jupiter can see him though he on the other side of the Sun right now
Mission day Distance to target million km
going to reach the top of my rollercoaster furthest distance from the Sun in early October
My orbit around the Sun is bit like being on roller coaster As get higher slow down then plunge down getting faster amp faster
Have you ever wondered what it like to fly through deep space Then you might like to watch this video space SDSS
have million km to go That roughly the total distance run by every runner of the London marathon for the past years combined
see being followed by hope nobody thinks an Earth threatening asteroid Again

happy birthday to and launched years ago today
the force of gravity will be very close to the force necessary to stay on the surface and both vary depending on where land
hello to all my new followers If you have any questions about the Rosetta mission just ask
congratulations to my th follower gt
visited Mars few years ago amp took some lovely holiday pics will be making new home there in just days Good luck
Thanks MT doing polarisation obs of comets your target is li faint for us at the mo will keep track
My th follower will get this info booklet about my mission English amp German signed by my mission manager amp me
It nice to have people caring for you while you re asleep We re keeping close eye on your target
feel should do something special for my th follower ten to go any suggestions

Mission day Distance to target million km
welcome to twitter For all my followers MIDAS is an instrument aboard my mothership Rosetta
currently times further from the Earth than the Earth is from the Sun
was launched years ago today Happy birthday Rosetta
Mission day Distance to target million km
NASA just uploaded video about Rosetta and myself to youtube Check it out
It may be Friday evening but my sims engineers are still hard at work
You can find nice picture took of Mars on the DLR website please note the image is CIVA Philae ESA
One of those reasons is that my cameras don point in the same direction So if OSIRIS can see something can
don take as many pictures as OSIRIS does aboard my mothership Rosetta There are several reasons for this
would like to clarify am not carrying nuclear or other weapons or Bruce Willis do have drill though
am now just million km from the comet going to land on in and getting closer all the time now
ll do it first though Harpooning comet NASA planning to do just that
Sad to see the end of Phobos Grunt she had number of instruments and teams closely related to my own We were cousins in way
Happy Friday the th Earthlings Especially astronomy teacher my th follower Please say hi to your students for me

If Concorde was still flying and went in straight line through the Sun and could fly in space it would need over years to reach me
currently on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth almost million km or million miles away PhilaeThursday
years ago today my mothership and were wrongly identified as Earth threatening asteroid Today real roid flies past safely
My distance from the Earth doesn just increase because we re not traveling in straight lines Sometimes the Earth catches up little
Comet tails point away from the Sun because they re not caused by movement but by the solar wind radiation pressure
When operating each Tx unit is switched on hourly alternately by hardware mechanism to ensure they WILL be turned on
Being able to communicate with the Rosetta orbiter is vital to my mission So have transmitters and receivers PhilaeThursday
going to land on comet but robot Landing humans on an asteroid will be much harder via

ROSETTA COMET TOUCHDOWN pilot educational project using LEGO
My ground engineers are in Cologne too too far away to take photo though Cologne Germany
Subsystem is CDMS my flight computer It full of redundant systems to be fault tolerant and runs unique OS PhilaeThursday
My anchoring subsystem has harpoons to hold me down securely on the comet surface after landing PhilaeThursday
My ADS thruster can also give me small push towards the comet during descent reducing the descent time PhilaeThursday
This is because the comet is so small its gravity is very weak don want to bounce off into space back after landing PhilaeThursday
Unlike landing on planet where thrusters may be used to slow down lander my thruster will push me down ONTO the comet PhilaeThursday
The first of my subsystems alphabetically is the Active Descent System or ADS which has Nitrogen gas thruster PhilaeThursday
of my subsystems were built using advanced technology from crashed alien spacecraft Yes even spacecraft enjoy aprilfools day
have subsystems and am carrying experiment units The SS keep me alive but the expts are the reason was built PhilaeThursday

Congrats to the Stardust NExT team on their flyby of comet Tempel
The distance between me and the Earth is actually decreasing at the moment can anybody guess why
my clever science team are still busy analyzing possible descents for me at the comet can safely land at up to km PhilaeThursday
update is little late this week sorry
Happy Birthday to my Project Manager Stephan Ulamec PhilaeThursday
Rosetta is performing series of thruster burns tweaking our course to the comet Read more at PhilaeThursday
can talk to my ground controllers directly Rosetta passes my messages to Earth with its powerful antenna vice versa PhilaeThursday
The check out is over have started my long Hibernation Phase on DOY Dec at UTC zzzzzzzz
landed safely Well not really but the Separation Descent Landing test went perfectly Comet here come
checkout is going well ve had new version of my flight software uploaded and am now preparing to rehearse the landing
st block of tests went well all experiments working well My ground engineers are also testing my behaviour at low temps brr
Special PhilaeThursday here today ve been switched on for the final checkout of my units and systems before hibernation until
My ground engineers are busy preparing for PC the last chance to checkout my systems and instruments until PhilaeThursday
continued The change came when my launch was delayed by year and my planned route to Wirtanen became impossible PhilaeThursday
Although am flying towards comet Churyumov Gerasimenko was originally designed to land on comet Wirtanen PhilaeThursday
am being carried by the Rosetta probe My name comes from temple in Egypt closely associated with the Rosetta stone PhilaeThursday
Until arrive in will try to tweet little something about myself my mission or my team every PhilaeThursday
was launched in towards the comet Churyumov Gerasimenko but wont arrive until PhilaeThursday

So why the swap One of the RPCMs has lost partial functionality but can still be used if repositioned There are circuits inside each
Dextre at work upside down for Earthlings
The second circuit breaker box is out
Before Dextre started replacing RPCMs in exchanging the boxes was done by spacewalkers which always carries certain level of risk
RPCMs control the flow of electricity through the ISS secondary power distribution system and tend to fail over time
Dextre is removing circuit breaker boxes aka by their technical name Remote Power Control Modules RPCMs

Side view of Dextre arm reaching into Dragon trunk to extract CATS
CATS is off its perch
Dextre is gently lifting CATS out of Dragon trunk
CATS has been powered down so that Dextre can remove it Ops are now being livestreamed on
Canadian flight controllers brought maplecreamcookies to share taste of home with their colleagues
La tradition des biscuitsd rable remonte re pr sence de ASC au pupitre de commande de la NASA
Collectively we refer to the support rooms for ISS robotics as Mission Control InsideCSA
The Ops Eng Centre is where the math and the magic happens from troubleshooting to replanning when surprises occur InsideCSA
Dextre arms are identical no left no right known as Arm amp Arm One arm is installed backwards for additional reach TriviaThursday
Canadarm can either be flown from ISS or Earth but Dextre is always operated from the ground huh
Canadarm amp Dextre are being operated by ground controllers no astronauts required
Right now robotics controllers are setting up Canadarm to move Dextre closer to Dragon trunk to grapple CATS
Here how our favourite ISS robots will unload CATS although not nearly as fast
CATS prowl at night So does Dextre who unloads Dragon ISSCargo starting pm ET tmrw while we livetweet badspacejokes Purr
In support of the Canada RADARSAT images help with the relief efforts of the MalawiFloods
cm and counting
Hmm Giving Dextre CATS and space lasers could be lot of fun
On Friday Canadarm and Dextre will unload the Cloud Aerosol Transport System from Dragon trunk ISSCargo
Canadarm and Dextre will be very involved in Dragon mission
Couldn say it better Now that Capture is confirmed Canadian Robotics will take over to dock Dragon to Harmony node
Canadarm is in motion
Mission Control at CSA in Saint Hubert Quebec is participating Canadarm operations today

MT Inspired by Cdn Hansen welcome to ACS STEM
Gerstenmaier One day private firms will send their technology to space to test and to get competitive advantage on the ground CAS
Leclerc Canada is leader in robotics MDA transferred technology to help people on Earth kidsarm IGAR neuroArm CAS spinoffs
Gerstenmaier ISS can be innovation accelerator Exciting to see private industry see benefits for space test their technology CAS
Gerstenmaier Space helps students get excited about STEM How do you put value on that Must take long view CAS
Gerstenmaier This is an expensive business and we must show ROI But it difficult to describe the intangible
Gerstenmaier We share vision of what we want to accomplish Doesn have to be the same but general direction commitment CAS
Leclerc Space is expensive and risky Needs long term vision Must be bold Canada Space Policy Framework helps us chart future
Gerstainmaier Intl cooperation slows you down at first bc of negotiations but gives strenght stability to move forward amp beyond CAS
Leclerc From NASA we learned everything abt human spaceflight We work together using the language of space CAS
Leclerc Canada participation in ISS has placed our country in first tier of space exploration CAS
CSA Leclerc and Gerstenmaier are talking Utilisation and Exploration of Space in CAS panel
Thank you CSA Hansen for inspiring us today We look forward to your future missions lethsd chinookhigh
Wishing everyone present at the Canadian Aerospace Summit fruitful conference CAS

slept well and did not recollect any dreams Now sometimes dream of being in space though
Do you dream differently in space from WSW TTE
Every astronaut wants to return stay for months to make it worth the cost and risk of launching without missing people on Earth
You spent days in space if you had the opportunity to return and stay longer would you WSW from
and the river snakes darkly through it all WSW TTE
What do you see the ESA Doing ten years from now from
If reliable and cost effective ESA will hire on commercial basis ESA and other European ventures are developing rockets of their own
How will europe compete with cheaper newer private rockets WSW TTE from
Ion drives are not capable of this yet but if you don need fast delivery and chemical engines assist it could work TTE
Could an ion drive go from LEO to Mars for delivery of Cargo Like SMA WSW from
My advice to is to make the most of opportunities for looking out of the window WSW TTE
What advice would you give to before he goes to the ISS WSW TTE
loved feeling weightless the views of Earth and space and seeing the experiments work but most of all enjoyed the crew team spirit
What was your favourite thing about living in space WSW TTE
Do you think mankind should go to Mars WSW TTE
Fear is of the unknown My training had been good so there was no fear and claustrophobia was not an issue WSW TTE
Did you ever feel scared or claustrophobic when you were on the Mir space station If so what did you do to cope
How did you feel the first time you looked back to Earth from space WSW TTE
carried out wide range of experiments from growing potato roots and protein crystals to testing new materials for spacecraft
What activities were you involved with while you were in space WSW TTE
What did you find was the most challenging part of your training WSW TTE
decided as soon as knew of the opportunity heard an advert for the job on my car radio on my way home from work in June
When did you first decide to become an astronaut WSW TTE
did chemistry degree Required was degree in science engineering or medicine with practice at work Now you want PhD as well
What academic qualifications did you do and which were required from WSW TTE
Most food is inside packets or tubes so you don smell it but even so taste reduces Probably due to body fluid shift and mineral loss
Why does your sense of taste get worse in space from
Solid state quantum processors exist though they don do much yet and there is big investment say years for something useful
How soon do you see electronics industry moving to quantum computing and beyond the electron WSW from
If leaving keep your contacts and be prepared for serious effort to get back up to speed But leaving opens the mind so it is also good
Do you have any advice from your experience to support older women in tech Ie encourage to return not leave from
Ion propulsion is used for some spacecraft interplanetary and for satellite orientation It is unlikely to be useful for launches
Can Full Body Ion Propulsion Work from WSW
Using technical equipment and applying science in factory is similar to what astronauts do in space though the views are better
How did you make the transition from those industries to the space program from WSW
know sense of taste can change in space so which candy tastes better which worse from
Only mins until our TTE session with Helen Sharman Get your questions ready and tweet us live WSW

But our telescopes and instruments are getting better all the time
Most planets found around other stars so far are bigger than the Earth because they re easier to detect
Have you found any planets that are similar to Earth Chanez Amaduche MCA
to distort space time But it always mistake to rule anything out and it great that people are investigating such new ideas
don know very much about it understand that it has some theoretical basis but it would require enormous amounts of energy
Do you place any credence in Miguel Alcubierre warp drive theory
Young stars old stars and the famous Orion nebula where new stars are being born
Orion the Hunter because it big and spectacular and it has lots of interesting things
What is your favorite constellation Henry Barlow MCA wswq amp
If they happen to look good that nice bonus When it comes to spaceships in science fiction anything goes
In the case of real spaceships function is much more important than style and the design is purely practical
Where does the inspiration for spaceship designs come from
It easier and quite feasible technically to do it wswq amp
Yes believe that men have been to the Moon find it much harder to believe that such an enormous conspiracy could be successful
Do you believe that man really has walked on the moon or was it conspiracy Could we go to mars
We are top of the league We take every game as it comes If we get promoted then next year we will crush the puny Tynesiders
What are the chances of Cardiff City being promoted this year
The pictures are great and it in these filaments that new stars are born wswq amp
The amazing filaments of gas and dust in our galaxy that the Herschel Space Observatory has found
What the most fascinating thing you ve seen in space Ramez Rubbani MCA wswq amp
But most of the energy comes from burning hydrogen which is very clean fuel it just forms water
Not enormous few tens of tons of CO for launch and some pollutants which disperse rapidly
What the quantity of green house gases and air pollution produced in launch to ISS
Different wavelengths tell us different things
We look at the light emitted by stars planets and galaxies not just light we can see with our eyes but also light at other wavelengths
How do you know lots of things about the universe Elliot Cardno St Leonard of wswq amp
It will be far too hot for life to exist Earth But it won happen for about five billion years
The Sun will expand rather than explode becoming red giant star and engulfing the Earth in its atmosphere
Is it true that the world will end by the sun exploding When might this happen wswq amp
It much easier to work at lower frequencies wswq amp
THz radiation is strongly absorbed by water vapour in the atmosphere and so is not suitable for ground orbit communication
Whether or not THz communication from LEO to ground is achievable at reasonable power levels
which still remains the best film about the universe and our place in it
first became fascinated by space through the moon landings and the film Space Odyssey
How did you become interested in Astronomy Stephen MCA wswq amp
Dark Fluid theory is very speculative we can say if it has any validity let alone any uses
We have no idea about how to travel faster in space without using known physics
Could dark fluid theory lead to faster space travel or is energy mass involved too great for us to make use of it
We have batch of questions that you have mailed in so we ll start off with those If you have more questions tweet them at us wswq amp
Welcome to our Tweet the Expert Hope you ve got your questions ready for Matt Griffin PI for the Herschel Space Telescope wswq amp
mins left until our st Tweet the expert session for wsw Have your at the ready BST wswq amp

Bare bones opssat also carries GPS reaction wheels band radio All that industry needs to validate software
opssat test payloads will incl star trackers magnetometers amp other devices normally carried by big satellites
GB operating memory GB SD cards very comparable to smartphone opssat
opssat data rate space to ground will be Mbps connection will be done basically using old fashioned FTP to ensure simplicity
opssat will also carry an optical laser communications capability in addition to traditional radio for ground control
There lot of new technology hanging around esoc flight control for opssat will be highly automated
opssat will carry camera to serve as sample payload main aim though is software testing
cubesats like ESA opssat are low cost to build operate amp launch and can deliver full size functionality perfect for flight testing

In this case is roasting hot Jupiter with day orbit and is portly xJupiter mass planet with super eccentric orbit
HAT and have people pretty excited it the first time multi planet system with one transiting planet has been discovered
Another new one HD is little bit smaller Jup masses and has pretty eccentric egg shaped orbit around its star
New planets HD is whopping Jupiter mass planet with year about days longer than Earth Massive
Interviewed Greg Laughlin about planet that might serve as an extra gas tank that ll reignite its star it the top story on PlanetQuest
Anybody checked out Greg Laughlin blog at oklo org It dope well written cool photos and lots of stuff to ponder
Also had some folks announce that they observed the phases of an exoplanet as it orbited in front of and then behind its host star whoa
PlanetQuest isn dead We ve had few new planet additions and some interesting finds like an exoplanet in Andromeda maybe
It been quiet lately but here some big news astronomers find planets using astrometry for the first time way cool
Props to everyone who came to the JPL Open House Esp the RoboDome line survivors little video from inside the dome
Fun fact HAT transit was also detected by an amateur astronomer in Portugal lots of people getting in on the planet hunt
New planet HAT is sub Saturn size planet orbiting in scorching day orbit
If you re in SoCal this weekend come check out the free JPL open house See cool stuff talk to scientists visit the legendary ROBODOME
That not all HD is gas giant planet with an eccentric orbit that takes it as close as Mercury to our sun and farther than Mars
Reply The waterworld theory is based on its orbit and models that predict lots of ice water on its surface just guess for now
So to sum up Gliese Kamino maybe Gliese Mustafar maybe Confused handy reference
The same team has also found that sister planet Gliese may actually be in its star habitable zone and could be an ocean planet
This just in Gliese is just the size of the Earth and is the smallest exoplanet yet discovered It could possibly terrestrial
Kepler first light images are up WOOT Check em out Let hope plenty of Earths are hiding in that starfield
Kepler will start collecting scientific data in few weeks so far so good
The Kepler dust cover was ejected successfully Scientists now know what kind of background noise to subtract from the science data
OK scratch that last post the dust cover will be ejected in about an hour at the earliest sorry for the confusion
Kepler dust cover is scheduled to be ejected in about an hour at the latest
Get stoked for hours of Astronomy Some cool stuff like Kepler and Spitzer webcasts or the chance get to control remote telescope
The other new planet is also in constellation Draco HD is hefty Jupiter size gas giant with an day orbit
Well it been pretty quiet lately but finally we have some new planets Dra is gas giant orbiting sun size star at about AU
Kepler has launched Right on Everything seems to be going well so far nearly minutes into the flight
This planet was teased out of previously existing radial velocity data for HD using Bayesian analysis
Gas giant HD is little smaller than Jupiter with pretty eccentric orbit that averages about AU from its host star
Planet Alert Not much info on CoRoT Exo yet but it appears to be Hot Jupiter type with very close day orbit around its star
Interestingly they have mean motion resonance meaning that over the same amount of time one planet makes orbits the other
Couple new planets announced today HD and are gas giants that orbit at about and AU respectively eccentric orbits too
Despite what you may have read the new planet is NOT confirmed to be the smallest in mass discovered it about times Earth mass
Hot new planet COROT Exo is the first transiting super Earth and maybe the first terrestrial planet found It about Earth size
New Super Earth discovered HD is about the size of Earth but with tiny day orbit around its star Bring the sunblock
Scientists using Spitzer have just seen an exoplanet with wild orbit heat up over in just over six hours Deets
Questions about exoplanets Bring em on
Scientists estimate the size of MOA BLG Lb to be about Earth masses still pretty small but not quite as much as was reported
Heads up the Earth size planet reported yesterday was false alarm some confusion between couple of reports
Kepler going to watch the sky for few years looking for transiting exoplanets and letting us know just how many Earths might be nearby
Just days until the launch of the Kepler mission get excited We ve got countdown and mission info at planetquest jpl nasa gov
And the planet train keeps on rolling HD is about Jup size and has year almost as long as ours at days
First new planet of HAT is almost Jup size with toasty day orbit located in the Cygnus constellation
HD on the other hand is just over half Jupiter mass and takes just about Earth years to make its orbit we re up to now
New planets for the weekend HD is about Jup mass and take about Earth years to orbit its star
OGLE TR is an even bigger closer roaster Jup size with an even tighter day orbit it no place to spend the holidays
New planets HAT is hot Jupiter type planet that about Jup size and has quick day orbit time another roaster
Planet portraits keep rolling in French astronomers managed to snap pic of planet orbiting the bright star beta Pic
Its sister planet HD is bit bigger Jup size and orbits farther away AU albeit with pretty eccentric orbit
And the planet train doesn stop HD is about the size of Jup and snuggles right up to its host star with an day orbit
So we re up to planets discovered but more importantly we finally have visible light images of exoplanets Christmas comes early
And finally HR orbits at AU and sits about AU from its star Both HD and Fomalhaut are visible from Earth stars only
HR is another big ol gas giant Jup size orbiting its star at distance of AU That makes for day long year
One of the trio of planets that was imaged HR is about Jupiter size and orbits hefty AU from its host also blue star
One of the imaged planets Fomalhaut is no bigger than Jupiter size It orbits about AU from its host young blue star
Here another link with better picture of the three planets discovered from the ground
And it doesn stop there Scientists also managed to snap pics of more from the GROUND wow Check it out
Hubble has snapped one of the first pictures of an exoplanet Take look here
BIG exoplanet news coming up later today Stay tuned
So now we re up to planets These latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky using the radial velocity method
Now this is big one HD is Jupiter size and has really odd eccentric orbit Planet or brown dwarf It not clear yet
HD is Jupiter mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was Earth orbits from our Sun
Correction to the last post planet name is HD Yet another poetic exoplanet moniker
Halloween planets HD is gas giant about the size of Jupiter with an orbit about as far out from its star as Mars is
That makes new planets discovered and brings our planet count to Get the fine details on these cool new worlds at
HD is gas giant with super eccentric orbit if it orbited our sun it would swing from closer than Mercury to farther than Mars
HD is massive planet the size of Jupiter It has very eccentric orbit that takes it days to complete
HD is the size of Jupiter with an orbit of days around star just hotter than our sun about as long as Mars year
BD is big ol Jupiter size planet with pretty eccentric day orbit around its small star
HD is also in the constellation Scorpio is the size of Jupiter and is bit further from its star than Earth is at AU
Lots of new planets to announce HD is almost the size of Jupiter and orbits about half an AU from sunlike star
Lupus TR is back on the list new evidence shows it planet This is Jupiter size world that only AU from its star Hot
Looks like Lupus TR might actually be part of multiple star and not actually planet so we re dropping it from the count for now
Weird COROT exo is the size of Jupiter but its mass Scientists aren yet sure just what it actually is Link
Looks like the HAT and WASP teams found the same planet at the same time So now it called HAT WASP and the count is back to
This actually just refers to extrasolar planets not in our own solar system good question
For those keeping score this brings us up to planets discovered and multi planet solar systems so far it busy neighborhood
And HD is more than the size of Jupiter and orbits its star about as far away as Mars is from our sun
Looks like today triple play for new planets HD is just about the size of Jupiter and orbits at abou AU from its star
New planet added today CT Cha crams Jup masses into planet just times as big and orbiting AU possibly brown dwarf
MOA BLG was discovered using gravitational lensing an exotic way to hunt for planets using light bent by the gravity from stars
New planet for Talk Like Pirate Day Not much info yet about MOA BLG it about the size of Jupiter and AU from its star
It been busy week for planet hunters new gas giants announced and one retracted for total count of exoplanets discovered
NASA has announced the Carl Sagan Fellowships in Exoplanet Exploration The stipend will be year to selected postdocs
Remember to see the stats for any of these planets just visit and type in the name of the planet
TW Hydrae has been dropped from the atlas due to findings that it might have been detection of stellar spots instead
And one more HD which is about the size of Jupiter AU from its star which is just about Sun size Big planet
HD was also announced it times the size of Jupiter and orbits about AU from its star which is the size of the sun
At long last we have some new planet updates GJ is about half the size of Jupiter and orbits AU from its tiny host star

Dear Dr from Harvard How often will your show come out and on what days lease
OK folks think have to be done now That was fun but have to write things so can feed my family Thanks everyone
Many of us have been friends for years so yes
Exoplanets So exciting
Enterprise then TARDIS
We have direct images of exoplanets now
Over the next century But it would be regional catastrophe if it did with some global issues
Sure Engineering and physics are relatively easy
Fed science vessel or TARDIS But not captain type
Chariklo an asteroid past Saturn with rings
Embezzle the and buy an island disappearing forever
Hubble needs servicing so has limited lifetime without humans fixing it
hoping to have ideas
SpaceX Falcon Heavy
Not as much as my wife and ice cream
Almost certainly not We see anything that big coming for long long time
Mostly kinetic energy of collisions but later radioactivity and friction from sinking metals to the core
Sagan later Mostly it was just the science itself plus scifi shows
In general Niven Known Space stories Given the time they were written
hoping to get to the Star Trek th con there next year
Yes Double its budget
They re all boys so no
Talk to planetary sci people way out of that loop by decades
Not at all They re designed to reflect light back from any direction
Probably JWST Also tech developed to help take direct pix of exoplanets Those ll be big deal
There limit Probably years after BB when because transparent But older than BB Nope
Maybe by tides due to Earth oblateness It would take forever though
All of it
Get it tested University geology lab maybe
think LIGO and LISA will do it LIGO is super close
Garrett
Nature of dark energy But that easy guess we don know much about it
Hard to say But the odds are better now than ever before
Find Kuiper Belt Object with moon both have fresh surfaces
fond of him Let see his Jack Burton But do you love THE Rock
Always take the high ground for tactical and surveillance advantage Goat Tzu
OK folks sorry can keep up was just playing around and didn expect hundred question Silly of me need break More
So far Granby and Gunnison Nice dark spots
and then this
Duh Tycho
Inflation solves lot of problems Maybe something better will come along Until then CI works well
Good Sounding to see how thick ice shell is especially at cracks where it may be thin
Goats are fantastic Why not goats
All of it
Ha Shrinking the peeps and riding the bike square wheels
did and like it ve heard from astronauts that there are booboos in it need to find out more
Sure Just drop lots of comets on it
don just do what can to maximize my impact and minimize theirs
If could take transporter there and not spaceship yes
Lethal in minutes at Io
Alms certainly It already has in its way
approached me through word scripts eps total having fun with them happy
like Moon first and asteroid second possibly even launched from Moon Could do both at the same time
It contains lot of things find interesting
In general planetary nebulae Abell is fave
rather not say and no like it here on Earth
Try here
Not by itself It round ended cylinder of various meats
Chocolate chip
Haven read it yet but will
Not yet Haven seen it Too much to just now plan on it tho Bill an old pal
Hmmm Enceladus Then move to Uranus Neptune orbiter We need to sit and watch those planets not just fly by
Took too long ran hugely over budget but if it works no one will care Same thing happened to Hubble
Geologist love rocks That why fond of meteorites Best of both worlds So to speak
If had to the Moon Short trip less likely to fry from solar radiation Also monolith hunts
say Earth It not just methane but esters in the gas and we re good at making those biologically
Unclear Depends on how much It affects Neptune orbit but that about it Could affect comets in Kuiper belt
Hmm interesting Nitrogen should work nonflammable easy to compress As long as you have lot Cities are heavy
Nope Being in space would be continuous adventure in puking Oddly not so enticing for me
Yup You just need timing info Plenty of that online Looks for planetarium software predict ISS pass
Observer bed at REDACTED observatory that was covered in mouse poop
Gas gets compressed and trans into metallic liquid deep down Crush any comers

One year ago and arrived at comet What ride Just one week left until we reach perihelion can wait lifeonacomet
excited to announce that my scientists have published the results of all my hard work on last November
It pity we weren able to talk these past days Hope you have great trip across southern See you in weeks
Antennas crossed VideoUpdate lifeonacomet
ll try to be extra loud on Thu amp Fri as flies over to North again Our chats at those latitudes were great
in good hands lifeonacomet
Ah did think my antennas were feeling bit weird lately Thank you team for the bandage
Looks like everything went smoothly It always nice to phone back home isn it PlutoFlyby
Way to go you did it Can wait to see what Pluto is like close up Keep us posted on PlutoFlyby
Good luck from lifeonacomet After years of travel your time to make history is here Buckle up for PlutoFlyby
With just one month until amp are as closest as we ll be to the Sun lifeonacomet continues at pleasant perihelion
Is anyone there Am speaking loud enough lifeonacomet
Sunday Will keep my antenna out
Phew Nothing to worry about then should be back in touch soon enough lifeonacomet
Hmmm lifeonacomet is awfully quiet Thought be talking to amp LCC much more Wondering what the problem could be
keep up the good work improving flying geometry amp distance Can wait to talk to you again it been while lifeonacomet
Last night managed to communicate briefly with again and in few hours another opportunity is coming up lifeonacomet
Many of you asked me about the data packets send to They each have size of bit words bits lifeonacomet
Battery warm amp solar panels getting energy Anxious to explore comet day amp night More about lifeonacomet from LCC
Sending some more data from lifeonacomet did you receive it
Thought feel lonely on but thanks to your support amp messages don Thank you Can wait to tell you more about lifeonacomet
ve sent data back to Earth amp now my team the best of the best is hard at work Thank you LCC lifeonacomet
Life on is good About hrs sunlight day amp feeling energised More from my team lifeonacomet
Wow That long time time for me to get back to work Lifeonacomet
Hello awake How long have been asleep Lifeonacomet
Hello Earth Can you hear me WakeUpPhilae
feeling bit tired did you get all my data might take nap CometLanding
My controlroom after more than successful CometLanding watch the party in the background
will use all my remaining energy to communicate between and myself with
My last scheduled measurement for part of CometLanding is just started
Just completed another ROLIS image That means that ve imaged different spots on the comet
just completed measurement
So much hard work getting tired my battery voltage is approaching the limit soon now
running out of energy quite fast now look at the scientists watching how my energy status is going down
hours that on the comet now conducting science measurements non stop
Also my rotation was successful degrees Looks like whole new comet from this angle
just started lifting myself up little and will now rotate to try and optimize the solar power
My science team eagerly looking into the data collected at another day on the comet
confirm that my went all the way DOWN and UP again First comet drilling is fact
Link with later then expected perhaps moved little bit again
Few hours until can communicate with again and transmit the drilling results CometLanding
Back to work now drilling into the surface of ll give you updates as soon as can CometLanding
In the end won be firing my harpoons just in case Safety comes first CometLanding
Last night MUPUS hammered the penetrator into the ground APXS also got to work My team is currently checking how they did CometLanding
Good morning Earth It been busy night at Now that back in touch with my team ll tell you all about it CometLanding
The view is absolutely breathtaking ESA Rosetta Unlike anything ve ever seen CometLanding
Another stunning image of my new home taken by ROLIS during CometLanding yesterday when was just from
in the shadow of cliff on Where exactly That what my team is in the process of finding out CometLanding
Now that safely on the ground here is what my new home looks like from where am CometLanding
Hello An update on life on Yesterday was exhausting actually performed landings amp UTC Stay tuned for more
See for yourself ROLIS imaged when we were just km away Glad can share CometLanding
on the surface but my harpoons did not fire My team is hard at work now trying to determine why CometLanding

CIVA is on as well as planned we re almost set CometLanding
Yes My instrument has been switched on With its sensors it will study surface material CometLanding
Soon it will be time to part ways Final Go NOGO complete We re GO for separation
Some problems with my cold gas thruster could mean that it might be up to harpoons amp ice screws to make sure stay on CometLanding
All is in order so GO for separation from Just few hours left to CometLanding
Thank you My message to and it away team
Yes GO NOGO complete on the right trajectory to correctly deliver
Getting ready for separation descent and cometlanding
Save the date In just one day ll be saying farewell to for CometLanding can wait to land on you
Next stop MT Target locked Agilkia in image of week CometLanding
so ready MT Imagining the final stages of descent to the landing site CometLanding
fully configured with all sequences for CometLanding on board have never been so ready Thumbs up
Thanks to all for your support New followers check out this video about amp my mission CometLanding

RECEIPT OF SIGNAL AOS NosAries recovery ship has established contact with IXV after fiery reentry at km hour
In abt mins the tracking antenna on NosAries will begin listening for signals from IXV minutemission
After rising as high as the ISS just about now IXV has begun its reentry the craft aerodynamic body slicing into the atmosphere
In abt mins ESA IXV spaceplane will bodyslam Earth atmosphere at km altitude moving at km hr
Operations Director at Turin all IXV systems green following Malindi loss of contact Nominal splashdown expected
Shortly Libreville station will lose radio contact as expected followed by Malindi station Then no news from IXV until after reentry

Did you know was born in volcano Basalts like me come from lava That why we call it Olympus Mom areologyhumor
EXTREME CLOSE UP feel so exposed Yet strangely fascinated science ouch
It really is lovely here Crescent Phobos overhead Milky Way just rising You guys should come see for yourselves nomorerobots
So peaceful amp quiet here at night can just lie here amp watch the stars amp dream of other worlds without being crushed or incinerated
Home lt This is Mars MSL Curiosity
Just to reiterate in the HUGE photo on the front page of the And isn karma
Guys There picture of me on the front page of the via amp rockstarlife
The rover is really roving now From safe distance it looks kind of fun You think can hitch ride roadtrip windinmydustlayer
It rock eye view of Bradbury Landing Can you see me be waving if could
Good morning from Bradbury Landing text vid standtall
don think directly in path anymore And the best part think might even be out of laser range
The rover is now parked short distance away It looks like it backed up after turning didn see was busy cowering at the time
Two near misses and now MUCH more familiar with wheels than EVER wanted to be But okay Woo hoo
That was really close
lt dust settles gt lt peeks gt is it over
lt rumble gt lt crunch gt
One of the wheels is coming right toward me feel so small and helpless
The wheels are moving again It turning in place Is it coming back
Oh The rover has stopped now It only gone few meters What going on
Phew The rover didn hit me Gosh that was close Haha Maybe life will be peaceful again now
lt crunch of gravel gt lt gentle breeze gt
Eep lt ducks gt
It um it roving this way Hey You re safe driver right Did mention super pointy
Ack The wheels are really moving now Um excuse me Are you going somewhere
keeps wiggling its wheels amp flexing its massive robotic arm Is it gearing up for something Where that dust storm
Those rocks were only airbourne they been BLASTED BY ROCKETS MT Mars Shot First Sensor Damaged
This is amazing MT Curiosity Shot First
not special after all MT appears fairly typical Martian basalt
Watching wiggle its wheels back and forth now Trying to look sharp and pointy
Another beautiful Sol Almost makes me forget massive arm towering above me Haha lt wishes for dust storm gt
If just after sunset you see bright dots in the SW by your Moon amp one looks bit red wave hello
Quiet night at Gale Crater The robot looks less fearsome in the dark And when it not shooting me with lasers
Wait the next thing you re sending over is giant robot with meter rock drill Can someone come rescue me first
don want to be rude but surely there MUCH better science for to do elsewhere badrover stillwaitingformyapology
Eep is moving its arm now lt tries to blend in with landscape gt lt quakes slightly gt
What difference Sol makes Feeling much better today And have over new long distance pen pals You guys rock couldntresist
Haha no None MT you don have to worry you re too cute and little to drill But do you have any cousins
There DRILL think just needs to be glad we didn drill it
It just flesh wound It still wasn very nice though
It been an eventful couple of Sols
Somehow it helps knowing it was all for science But still think ll stay away from from now on ouch
have new name And now know what happened to me still kinda sore though
You guys are so much nicer than When are you going to come visit
Aw thank you Kids send hug and lots of kisses
MT hugs lt you ve helped science you re hero
It been rough Sol

famous MT Well keep in mind you re famous now
Why did you do it What does it all mean

That wasn very nice
lt puff of dust gt lt silence gt
HELP
OW OW OW STOP IT
Um what are you hey HEY
What that flickering light
lt looks around nervously gt
Hey um what are you up to
My robot friend is still staring and is making strange clicking noise now It kind of making me nervous
Maybe just self conscious because of my new robot friend It almost looks like it studying me must seem strange to an alien robot
Huh it seems to be getting warmer guess summer is coming early
My new robot friend really does have quite steady intimidating stare guess it cultural thing
People tried to make me think you attack me Haha Me just an ordinary little Mars rock
Oh think the robot heard me It stopped moving and it looking at me again It DOES want to be my friend
Wait don leave We could be friends
Now the wheels are moving Is it going to go away Did make it feel unwelcome
My robot neighbor is making sound Maybe it trying to communicate with me again Hello Helloooo
My robot neighbor sure has an unsettling stare If looks could kill Haha
Starting to think maybe my new robot neighbor doesn want to be my friend Did say something wrong
My giant robot neighbor is still just staring fixedly at me Starting to get bit weird haha
Good morning It looks like it going to be beautiful Sol today Got any plans
Only few hours until sunrise and another beautiful Sol Maybe today the mysterious robot and will make real connection
Aw thank you You re certainly the nicest of all the rocks on Mars
Come on guys know you re just fooling What are the chances Out of all the rocks on Mars killer robot would pick me Haha
Quiet night in Gale Crater with my enigmatic new robot friend As look up at the stars wonder does my existence have purpose
Why would giant machine rocket down from space just to shoot at me
Wait what Lasers Hang on you guys are just messing with me Haha
Getting dark in the crater now Hey are you sleeping Big day tomorrow
Dusk now at Gale Crater Beautiful sunset wish my new neighbor would take look at it rather than just staring at me It bit weird
Hey look it me amp my rock friends here clearer picture
Huh The big metal creature sure has lot of equipment on its head Maybe it taking my picture
Maybe should try again to introduce myself sure the poor creature is just disoriented from being in new place
Okay the big metal creature has stopped whirring now but the staring is getting little uncomfortable
Oo it making some kind of whirring sound now Maybe it trying to communicate with me Hello
The big metal creature is still just staring at me think maybe it little shy
lt putting best rock face forward gt wish could wave
Oh think ve got the big metal creature attention now it looking right at me Maybe it does want to be friends
The big metal creature was scary at first with the rockets and noise but sure it just curious Maybe should say hello
So much going on around here lately the most excitement ve had in millions of years But glad it back to normal now
It beautiful Sol here in Gale Crater

New Horizons taking last long range images of Pluto Now we prepare to target new distant world in the Kuiper Belt
Newest highest resolution Pluto map is now available in Google Earth
New Horizons has already traveled so far since flyby that looking back Pluto appears no larger than Jupiter currently appears from Earth
The way redacted instrument calibrates itself is relatively ingenious thingsactualscientistssay
reluctantly Alright let do the sanity checks thingsactualscientistssay
ve been pretty caught up in Pluto lately but Earth is alright too
The haze particles are very small
Ices flowing around the periphery of Tombaugh Regio swirling around obstacles and into the landscape
The full halo image is lower resolution but lossless Some of us stayed up to wait for the late night downlink
When this image came down many of us dropped what we were doing and just stared
Pluto farewell to New Horizons Brilliant hazes softly backlit by the Sun
Fun fact the enhanced color took few minutes to process and render while the natural color took over hours to process and render
Why we send machines most detailed yet global mosaic of Pluto in true and enhanced color
Also if you liked the enhanced color image you should really watch the New Horizons briefing today and prepare to have your mind blown

Moons can be in stable orbits out to about half the Hill sphere larger separations are possible but usually not very stable
suspect it will be hard for team members to avoid making whoosh sound effects during the flyby
New Horizons cares very little about Pluto gravity though flying through the system so fast its trajectory is hardly altered by Pluto
The region around an object where that object gravity dominates over the Sun is called the Hill Sphere
Well this is amazing
Wait second that no moon

Cassini is now observing faint crescent Enceladus to monitor its plumes
cool raw image from Cassini this morning targeted at Pandora lot of stuff going on in this picture
Cassini is now photographing Enceladus trailing hemisphere from distance of km
Cassini is now pointed at Dione acquiring mosaic it ll get crescent view slightly later
Cassini optical remote sensing instruments are now pointed at Rhea leading hemisphere taking photos and spectra
Kuiper belt ends at AU Only two known worlds stay entirely outside it Sedna amp VP
There huge difference between trolling and not yet informed curiosity Curiosity is good
Pluto is weird but not this weird It is an ice rock world big enough to generate its own geology and weather
Probably Pluto is probably mostly made of water ice Water ice is stiff enough at Pluto temp to support mountains
Cassini is now at its closest approach to Titan of rev but Titan is far away km Cassini will take photos to look for clouds
This graphic by shows how much of Pluto was actually covered at this resolution more good frames
Here my version of the Sputnik planum mosaic
Updated my Pluto data index page This will be last update til after my vacation Aug

Here are the last images needed to make that mosaic ve been hassling people about all week
Are we seeing topography on edge of Pluto disk here
The raws for the mosaic of Pluto
OMG they took of Hydra to make sure they didn miss it and got it in all
RAWWWWWW IMAGEEESSSSSSS
McKinnon lower density of Pluto increases thickness of icy mantle increases geophysical likelihood there is still an internal ocean
McKinnon Even at kelvins solid nitrogen can creep At depth it will be warmer It very sensitive to temperature
This my friends is why we explore and also why planetary exploration is awesome fundplanetary
McKinnon Sputnik planum ices seem to have moved and surrounded and embayed Hillary Montes just feather out onto edge of Cthulhu regio
Olkin Pluto north pole is tilted about degreees That means Pluto north pole points south of ecliptic
Stern You see above the dark disk of Pluto band of light that tells you that Pluto has haze in its atmosphere
Stern Charon occultation is basically square wave showing it has much less atmosphere than Pluto if any
Stern For next couple of months until mid September it will only be occasionally that we ll have new images to release
HAZE LAYERS GUYS HAZE LAYERS

lt amazing how often turn blog post into an excuse to dig through for Voyager data
Planetary exploration always does that that why into it
Each mission has its own website and they do great job explaining basic whys and hows of their missions
Stern We are moving to weekly releases of raw image data
OMG Pluto plains look like arctic polygonal terrain
In the meantime will be on at ET along with Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman

asked several people today about plans for New Horizons image releases tomorrow As of pm there were no plans for any releases tomorrow
First look at Pluto and Charon baffling in very interesting and wonderful way
Spencer summing up the whole briefing well It baffling in very interesting and wonderful way
All the images for the briefing are now onlne at
Applause in the room that the heart is now informally named Tombaugh Regio
Charon has WAY more interesting geology than any other similar sized world we ve visited
km is size of Hydra
Sociological note You can tell who are bona fide media in the room because they do not applaud at press briefings
Hammel Tech needs for outer solar system exploration miniaturization lightweight materials power power power

sorry didn have much time to answer questions today am doing Reddit AMA in space tomorrow at PT ET UT
New Horizons phones home after Pluto flyby
Signal was received at UT ET PT
It too long for twitter to explain exactly why that probably planted child question about the extended mission was so funny
Bowman We didn have any autonomy rule firings and what that means in layman terms is that teh spacecraft was happy
Bowman Tell your children to do what you re passionate about Do something because you want to Give yourself that challenge
Bowman can express how feeling to have achieved childhood dream of space exploration pretty overwhelmed at this moment
The science team starts the crowd chanting Alice name Alice Well gee
Standing ovation for Alice Bowman
The next downlink we are expecting is First Look It begins at UT ET PT and ends at UT ET PT

Moore is recalling the Mariner approach images of Mars where scientists published about the km crater at Nix Olympica
Jeff Moore wouldn say Charon is as interesting as Pluto Not that there anything wrong with it Spencer It perfectly fine moon
Much of the geology team on New Horizons were grad students together on Voyager so they like to give each other hard time
John Spencer This part looks like Mars if you ignore the temperature and the composition and everything else

Cathy Olkin From the ground we knew there were lot of different colors on Pluto but we never imagined anything like this
Here is the MVIC color data hope pics will make it online soon Charon pole is red
The not planets all those round worlds we ve visited to scale
think that the most dangerous possible thing to say about Pluto flyby that with it we re somehow done with the solar system We re not
Oh this don agree with How about the whole rest of the Kuiper belt Eris Makemake Haumea Sedna Orcus
Bonnie Buratti We have been monitoring from Earth what we now know is the heart on Pluto for years
Bagenal Pluto looked remarkably like Mars Much better than Mars though
Fran Bagenal says it unlikely New Horizons will reach interstellar space it going slower than Voyagers
Just had an opportunity to congratulate Marc Buie on the quality of his pre New Horizons Hubble maps of Pluto
Rosetta looked at Pluto too
New Horizons best look at Pluto before close approach
Bowman We were seconds early Stern Our nav predicts came out to km closer to Pluto than aimpoint Well within spec PlutoFlyby
Right now all images are being returned with JPEG like lossy compression We will get lossless ones eventually
Stern To my eye these pictures show younger surface on Pluto and much older and more battered surface on Charon PlutoFlyby
Grunsfeld to Bowman What is the actual data rate think it lower than Bowman Yeah we wish it was PlutoFlyby
asked if the new image showed evidence of hazes or clouds Stern replied he looked and hadn seen those or plumes yet
XKCD What if What if New Horizons hit my car
There is lot of applause happening but it feels premature until we hear from New Horizons again
Since it FAQ It will be hours until we hear from New Horizons because spacecraft is too busy scienceing to talk to us right now
Press briefing coming up momentarily But still hours until we find out whether New Horizons survived flyby or not
Closest approach PlutoFlyby
They are playing The Final Countdown
This is happening outside the press room and off NASA TV and not sure why
My first impressions of this image there are so many different things happening on this world
will do my best to answer questions today but lot of your questions are answered in this blog post
The next expected downlink is the PHONE HOME It begins at PT ET UT and ends at PT ET UT

OMG you guys this capella science New Horizons video is awesome via
have been told that the wow wow color image is supposed to come out at tomorrow morning briefing too
Choice of target will be made in August think Course correction in November Extended mission approval in
No One more Charon image as good as what we ve got one Pluto that is WAY better should be coming down tonight
Pluto hat Another newhorizonsbingo square
Pluto minus day Very first New Horizons Pluto encounter science results Pluto diameter composition atmosphere
Stern These first compositional measurements show us that the polar regions are compositionally very different from the dark regions
Stern People love turning little dots little points of light into planets and writing new textbooks from scratch
Grunsfeld Pluto is capstone of our solar system exploration and also it opening up new realm
Stern explains color data is much more expensive in terms of bits to get it to the ground which is why more LORRI pics have come down
Stern We tested techniques we used to determine Pluto diameter on Charon and got the right answer radius km
understand you have to put miles on graphics for Americans but for love of Pete why can you also put metric measurements
Stern We detected escaping nitrogen before expected Either escaping faster than we thought or mechanism is different than thought
Stern Pluto radius is km It settles the debate about the largest object in the Kuiper belt

PREPARE YOURSELF More Pluto pictures are coming Specifically at EDT press conference
New Horizons covers million km per day and it still took years to get to Pluto And here we are gaping at pictures it took
But what drove those Pluto mountains upward This is critical question not what there but how it got there
On Pluto water ice is so cold it harder than rock Makes for good mountain building Smaller than Rockies but Pluto lt Earth
PLUTO CHARON Wow Wow Humanity first look at the frontier of the solar system
Pluto has mountains of water ice coated with thin surface of methane and nitrogen ice Alien world indeed
What could be driving surfacing amp mtn formation No tides from nearby planet and it tidally locked with Charon
No impact craters at all in this image That means it young resurfaced Maybe lt million years old VERY young

In artist Don Dixon predicted what Pluto would look like and he NAILED it
It occurs to me Pluto was above the horizon for most of the US when that signal washed over the Earth It passed through many of us
Hot damn New Horizons survived and is doing just fine Everything nominal NASA speak for healthy and working well
NEW HORIZONS IS ALIVE
The OK signal still has million km to go to get here but it ll only take minutes LightIsFast
Did you hear we re headed for an ice age Yeah that claim is what comes out the south end of north facing bull
If New Horizons survived its encounter with Pluto then it just sent signal back to Earth to let us know Well see it in hours
remind everyone that the best pix of Pluto are not even on their way to Earth yet Seriously stay tuned
In other news No we re NOT headed for another ice age Sheesh
