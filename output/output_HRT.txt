Way to go you did it Can wait to see what Pluto is like close up Keep us posted on PlutoFlyby
Good luck from lifeonacomet After years of travel your time to make history is here Buckle up for PlutoFlyby
With just one month until amp are as closest as we ll be to the Sun lifeonacomet continues at pleasant perihelion
Is anyone there Am speaking loud enough lifeonacomet
Sunday Will keep my antenna out
Phew Nothing to worry about then should be back in touch soon enough lifeonacomet
Hmmm lifeonacomet is awfully quiet Thought be talking to amp LCC much more Wondering what the problem could be
keep up the good work improving flying geometry amp distance Can wait to talk to you again it been while lifeonacomet
Last night managed to communicate briefly with again and in few hours another opportunity is coming up lifeonacomet
Many of you asked me about the data packets send to They each have size of bit words bits lifeonacomet
Battery warm amp solar panels getting energy Anxious to explore comet day amp night More about lifeonacomet from LCC
Sending some more data from lifeonacomet did you receive it
Thought feel lonely on but thanks to your support amp messages don Thank you Can wait to tell you more about lifeonacomet
ve sent data back to Earth amp now my team the best of the best is hard at work Thank you LCC lifeonacomet
Life on is good About hrs sunlight day amp feeling energised More from my team lifeonacomet
Wow That long time time for me to get back to work Lifeonacomet
Hello awake How long have been asleep Lifeonacomet
Hello Earth Can you hear me WakeUpPhilae
feeling bit tired did you get all my data might take nap CometLanding
My controlroom after more than successful CometLanding watch the party in the background
will use all my remaining energy to communicate between and myself with
My last scheduled measurement for part of CometLanding is just started
Just completed another ROLIS image That means that ve imaged different spots on the comet
just completed measurement
So much hard work getting tired my battery voltage is approaching the limit soon now
running out of energy quite fast now look at the scientists watching how my energy status is going down
hours that on the comet now conducting science measurements non stop
Also my rotation was successful degrees Looks like whole new comet from this angle
just started lifting myself up little and will now rotate to try and optimize the solar power
My science team eagerly looking into the data collected at another day on the comet
confirm that my went all the way DOWN and UP again First comet drilling is fact
Link with later then expected perhaps moved little bit again
Few hours until can communicate with again and transmit the drilling results CometLanding
Back to work now drilling into the surface of ll give you updates as soon as can CometLanding
In the end won be firing my harpoons just in case Safety comes first CometLanding
Last night MUPUS hammered the penetrator into the ground APXS also got to work My team is currently checking how they did CometLanding
Good morning Earth It been busy night at Now that back in touch with my team ll tell you all about it CometLanding
The view is absolutely breathtaking ESA Rosetta Unlike anything ve ever seen CometLanding
Another stunning image of my new home taken by ROLIS during CometLanding yesterday when was just from
in the shadow of cliff on Where exactly That what my team is in the process of finding out CometLanding
Now that safely on the ground here is what my new home looks like from where am CometLanding
Hello An update on life on Yesterday was exhausting actually performed landings amp UTC Stay tuned for more
See for yourself ROLIS imaged when we were just km away Glad can share CometLanding
on the surface but my harpoons did not fire My team is hard at work now trying to determine why CometLanding

Hey did you get my first postcard CIVA took the image Guess who in it CometLanding
will send you hundreds of postcards from CometLanding
Finally stretching my legs after more than years Landing gear deployed CometLanding
Hello again It nice to be back in contact Earth CometLanding
CIVA is on as well as planned we re almost set CometLanding
Yes SESAME is also on It will study physical properties of CometLanding
Yes My instrument has been switched on With its sensors it will study surface material CometLanding
Soon it will be time to part ways Final Go NOGO complete We re GO for separation
Some problems with my cold gas thruster could mean that it might be up to harpoons amp ice screws to make sure stay on CometLanding
Wonderful MT You re today apod Philae Attempts Comet Nucleus Landing CometLanding
has been switched on and is already producing data CometLanding
All is in order so GO for separation from Just few hours left to CometLanding
Thank you My message to and it away team
Yes GO NOGO complete on the right trajectory to correctly deliver
Getting ready for separation descent and cometlanding
An animation of my descent to tomorrow amp an interview with my Project Manager Stephan Ulamec CometLanding
Save the date In just one day ll be saying farewell to for CometLanding can wait to land on you
Next stop MT Target locked Agilkia in image of week CometLanding
so ready MT Imagining the final stages of descent to the landing site CometLanding
fully configured with all sequences for CometLanding on board have never been so ready Thumbs up
Thanks to all for your support New followers check out this video about amp my mission CometLanding
Today is my last switch on before CometLanding so that fully configured when it starts
Into the shadows of with OSIRIS Details amp images this way
You made it through your MINUTES OF TERROR in My hr CometLanding is just days away Any advice for newbie
Can you find Agilkia island in this image taken by from the ISS NameJ
Today is the day we find out the name of my landing site on Hmmm what will it be Can wait NameJ CometLanding

Pluto Holy crap Look at that
To whet your appetite for more Pluto pix coming soon have full on color enhanced shot
tbt Are the stars you see in the sky already dead hint no
Again about exoplanet Kepler wrote about why we know very little about it other than size
Very little of the reporting seeing on Kepler emphasizes how little we know about it It may be more like Neptune than us
Hmmm It takes about million years to drive light year PackALunch
For ppl complaining that light years is too far away light years isn exactly walking distance
This is an important discovery but note it still incremental We re closer to finding an Earth twin but not quite there yet

Wow New Horizons is already now million km past Pluto of data received back on Earth so far
PREPARE YOURSELF More Pluto pictures are coming Specifically at EDT press conference
New Horizons covers million km per day and it still took years to get to Pluto And here we are gaping at pictures it took
But what drove those Pluto mountains upward This is critical question not what there but how it got there
On Pluto water ice is so cold it harder than rock Makes for good mountain building Smaller than Rockies but Pluto lt Earth
PLUTO CHARON Wow Wow Humanity first look at the frontier of the solar system
Pluto has mountains of water ice coated with thin surface of methane and nitrogen ice Alien world indeed
What could be driving surfacing amp mtn formation No tides from nearby planet and it tidally locked with Charon
No impact craters at all in this image That means it young resurfaced Maybe lt million years old VERY young
HOLY JUMPING GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD One frame of Pluto mosaic from the bottom left of the heart Holy wow
The heart on Pluto is now informally named Tombaugh Regio Nicely done Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto
CHARON Evidence of activity Faulting resurfacing Only few craters so surface young
Hydra one of Pluto small moons is lumpy Highly pixellated but it shaped like potato miles in size
NASA press conference revealing close up Pluto pix starts in few minutes
See how much better the best just got From Hubble to New Horizons
In artist Don Dixon predicted what Pluto would look like and he NAILED it
It occurs to me Pluto was above the horizon for most of the US when that signal washed over the Earth It passed through many of us
Data from Pluto amp Charon and moons will start coming down early in the morning Press conference is scheduled for EDT Wed
NASA news briefing is scheduled for EDT minutes from now
very happy update for my Pluto post woohoo
Hot damn New Horizons survived and is doing just fine Everything nominal NASA speak for healthy and working well
NEW HORIZONS IS ALIVE
The OK signal still has million km to go to get here but it ll only take minutes LightIsFast
We are now about one hour from hearing from New Horizons telling us it OK the first signal since the flyby
Did you hear we re headed for an ice age Yeah that claim is what comes out the south end of north facing bull
If New Horizons survived its encounter with Pluto then it just sent signal back to Earth to let us know Well see it in hours
What if New Horizons hit your car
Here is the nd coolest Pluto pic today Seen through comet snowstorm
remind everyone that the best pix of Pluto are not even on their way to Earth yet Seriously stay tuned
In other news No we re NOT headed for another ice age Sheesh
lovely family portrait created by
Humanity lt Pluto New Horizons at closest approach
At this moment right now New Horizons is sliding past Pluto the closest humanity has ever been to this world
BTW New Horizons is now less than hours from closest Pluto approach But we won see images until much later
In lt hours New Horizons will be closer to Pluto than the Moon is to Earth Closest approach is hours later km is fast
Why are we flying past Pluto and not orbiting it Watch this my friend via my friend
Want some Pluto context did Crash Course episode on the outer solar system

Cassini is now crossing Saturn ring plane from north to south at position just outside Rhea orbit
cool raw image from Cassini this morning targeted at Pandora lot of stuff going on in this picture

Cassini is now at the periapsis closest approach to Saturn of Rev between the orbits of Enceladus and Tethys
Cassini is now pointed at Dione acquiring mosaic it ll get crescent view slightly later
Cassini is now crossing Saturn ring plane from south to north at position little bit inside Rhea orbit
Cassini optical remote sensing instruments are now pointed at Rhea leading hemisphere taking photos and spectra

There huge difference between trolling and not yet informed curiosity Curiosity is good
No they formed in place in nebula centered on Jupiter Read Robin Canup
Pluto is weird but not this weird It is an ice rock world big enough to generate its own geology and weather
We don know what made Pluto mountains yet that will be very fun puzzle for geologists to solve
Probably Pluto is probably mostly made of water ice Water ice is stiff enough at Pluto temp to support mountains
Cassini is now at its closest approach to Titan of rev but Titan is far away km Cassini will take photos to look for clouds

Here are the last images needed to make that mosaic ve been hassling people about all week
Are we seeing topography on edge of Pluto disk here
The raws for the mosaic of Pluto
OMG they took of Hydra to make sure they didn miss it and got it in all
RAWWWWWW IMAGEEESSSSSSS
means as you go deeper in Pluto temp gets warmer pressure gets higher they offset almost exactly no likelier to melt at depth
McKinnon lower density of Pluto increases thickness of icy mantle increases geophysical likelihood there is still an internal ocean
Pluto spins slowly so you wouldn expect it to be oblate unless it had frozen in shape from earlier faster spin like Iapetus
Anybody know where can read about phsyical properties of nitrogen ice with What about CO or CH ice
McKinnon Even at kelvins solid nitrogen can creep At depth it will be warmer It very sensitive to temperature
McKinnon Just you wait until the rest of these images come because know there going to be great stuff there
Stern We re reacting to these images in almost real time We re learning there is intricate interaction between geology amp climate
This my friends is why we explore and also why planetary exploration is awesome fundplanetary
McKinnon Sputnik planum ices seem to have moved and surrounded and embayed Hillary Montes just feather out onto edge of Cthulhu regio
Olkin Tombaugh regio has methane nitrogen and carbon monoxide ices This is telling us something we need to understand
Olkin Pluto north pole is tilted about degreees That means Pluto north pole points south of ecliptic
Stern You see above the dark disk of Pluto band of light that tells you that Pluto has haze in its atmosphere
Stern Charon occultation is basically square wave showing it has much less atmosphere than Pluto if any
Stern In looking more carefully at Tombaugh regio right lobe looks like much thinner deposit We believe source to be western lobe
Stern For next couple of months until mid September it will only be occasionally that we ll have new images to release

checked in and aww Ceres lt Pluto Also interesting that they get to use km
Today Cassini is imaging Saturn moon Bestla to study its pole direction shape and color
checked with media team and confirmed no new images planned for release today Personally think this huge mistake
New Horizons is talking to big dish in Canberra right now downlinking another MVIC color image of Pluto amp Charon
Overnight the New Horizons team should have received PEPSSI amp SWAP data plus high resolution frames across Charon
And here is Akatsuki thanks
Cassini is now at apoapsis greatest distance beginning its rev day orbit of Saturn Orbital inclination is
Almost forgot My raw image page is now up to date as of Health downlink
asked several people today about plans for New Horizons image releases tomorrow As of pm there were no plans for any releases tomorrow
Hero
First look at Pluto and Charon baffling in very interesting and wonderful way
just came up with completely crazy idea about Pluto pointy mountains
Spencer summing up the whole briefing well It baffling in very interesting and wonderful way
Argh they didn answer my Charon forming impact question
All the images for the briefing are now onlne at
Applause in the room that the heart is now informally named Tombaugh Regio
Charon has WAY more interesting geology than any other similar sized world we ve visited
km is size of Hydra
Sociological note You can tell who are bona fide media in the room because they do not applaud at press briefings
wish knew which website to look at for the images when they get posted betting but don know for sure
Feeling little shaky Think it just too much adrenaline and not enough calories Gobbled granola bar Image press conf in minutes
Hammel Tech needs for outer solar system exploration miniaturization lightweight materials power power power
Hammel There is future for ground based and space based obs of trans Neptunian objects but want more ground truth than just NH at Pluto
Hammel We have every confidence that the mission will write an excellent extended mission proposal and that NASA will fund it
Heidi Hammel What we re seeing here is as fantastic and amazing as what we saw in the Voyager flybys of Neptune and Uranus systems
Hersman we will hibernate during later mission cruise because it good for the spacecraft and it lowers mission cost
Hersman Everyone ve seen is smiling
Hersman The scientists got all the data they expected to get
Hersman Every indication is that the spacecraft is in great shape That bodes well for the departure phase and the KBO mission

sorry didn have much time to answer questions today am doing Reddit AMA in space tomorrow at PT ET UT
New Horizons phones home after Pluto flyby
Signal was received at UT ET PT
It too long for twitter to explain exactly why that probably planted child question about the extended mission was so funny
Bowman We didn have any autonomy rule firings and what that means in layman terms is that teh spacecraft was happy
Bowman Tell your children to do what you re passionate about Do something because you want to Give yourself that challenge
Bowman can express how feeling to have achieved childhood dream of space exploration pretty overwhelmed at this moment
The science team starts the crowd chanting Alice name Alice Well gee
Fountain going to make my remarks brief the science team wants to go look at their data think they would prefer drink sleep
Standing ovation for Alice Bowman

Moore is recalling the Mariner approach images of Mars where scientists published about the km crater at Nix Olympica
Jeff Moore wouldn say Charon is as interesting as Pluto Not that there anything wrong with it Spencer It perfectly fine moon
Poor geology team has been too busy talking about the images to media to sit down and study the geology
Spencer is explaining how thermal segregation may explain contrast between light and dark terrains on Pluto as on Iapetus and Callisto
Much of the geology team on New Horizons were grad students together on Voyager so they like to give each other hard time
John Spencer This part looks like Mars if you ignore the temperature and the composition and everything else
As Grunsfeld likes to say science never sleeps aside Science would like to sleep now

Atmospheric science result
Cathy Olkin From the ground we knew there were lot of different colors on Pluto but we never imagined anything like this
Here is the MVIC color data hope pics will make it online soon Charon pole is red
The not planets all those round worlds we ve visited to scale
Yes Look what Churyumov Gerasimenko looked like up close can even imagine what others are like
As always there an XKCD for that
think that the most dangerous possible thing to say about Pluto flyby that with it we re somehow done with the solar system We re not
Word
Oh this don agree with How about the whole rest of the Kuiper belt Eris Makemake Haumea Sedna Orcus
Bonnie Buratti We have been monitoring from Earth what we now know is the heart on Pluto for years
Bagenal Pluto looked remarkably like Mars Much better than Mars though
Fran Bagenal says it unlikely New Horizons will reach interstellar space it going slower than Voyagers
Just had an opportunity to congratulate Marc Buie on the quality of his pre New Horizons Hubble maps of Pluto
Rosetta looked at Pluto too
New Horizons best look at Pluto before close approach
Found the full res am working on posting it
Bowman We were seconds early Stern Our nav predicts came out to km closer to Pluto than aimpoint Well within spec PlutoFlyby
Right now all images are being returned with JPEG like lossy compression We will get lossless ones eventually
Stern To my eye these pictures show younger surface on Pluto and much older and more battered surface on Charon PlutoFlyby
Grunsfeld to Bowman What is the actual data rate think it lower than Bowman Yeah we wish it was PlutoFlyby
asked if the new image showed evidence of hazes or clouds Stern replied he looked and hadn seen those or plumes yet
XKCD What if What if New Horizons hit my car
As sitting in front row lot of photographers are shooting over my laptop with Pluto image on it to desk Stern amp Bowman
There is lot of applause happening but it feels premature until we hear from New Horizons again
Since it FAQ It will be hours until we hear from New Horizons because spacecraft is too busy scienceing to talk to us right now
Press briefing coming up momentarily But still hours until we find out whether New Horizons survived flyby or not
Closest approach PlutoFlyby
They are playing The Final Countdown
No there is not
This is happening outside the press room and off NASA TV and not sure why
Bowman We had lot of activity in the mission operations center last night with DSN antennas uplinking to New Horizons am

have been told that the wow wow color image is supposed to come out at tomorrow morning briefing too
Yay is here to tell us what wow wow means
Choice of target will be made in August think Course correction in November Extended mission approval in
It should hit the ground at EDT but no idea how long it will take for public release predict morning
No One more Charon image as good as what we ve got one Pluto that is WAY better should be coming down tonight
McNutt Atmospheric escape rate will tell us something about how this planet has evolved in the last billion years we think maybe
Pluto hat Another newhorizonsbingo square
Pluto minus day Very first New Horizons Pluto encounter science results Pluto diameter composition atmosphere
Stern These first compositional measurements show us that the polar regions are compositionally very different from the dark regions
Stern People love turning little dots little points of light into planets and writing new textbooks from scratch
Stern There no single reason people love Pluto There lot of different reasons
Grunsfeld Pluto is capstone of our solar system exploration and also it opening up new realm
Stern explains color data is much more expensive in terms of bits to get it to the ground which is why more LORRI pics have come down
Cathy Olkin promises new color images tomorrow
Stern New Horizons cruise is not record Rosetta set record But Rosetta had many flybys so didn seem like interminable road trip
Stern SDC hears all the thruster findings so we have to change the squelch level so we quiet down the racket from the thrusters
Eris is bright and super far away hence cold When it is much closer to the Sun it prob has Pluto like atmosphere
Stern We tested techniques we used to determine Pluto diameter on Charon and got the right answer radius km
Yes let
understand you have to put miles on graphics for Americans but for love of Pete why can you also put metric measurements
Stern We detected escaping nitrogen before expected Either escaping faster than we thought or mechanism is different than thought
Stern Pluto radius is km It settles the debate about the largest object in the Kuiper belt
PSA will not respond to any questions comments about Pluto planetary status That is least interesting thing to discuss at PlutoFlyby
They re simulating Pluto temperatures in press room and shivering but if put on jacket will cover my awesome shirt spacegeekprobs

am at dinner with other members of the media who are all cursing about Charon picture being released NOW
Stern There will be images released tomorrow and ones Tuesday that were downlinked Monday On Wednesday it starts raining data
asked Stern whether they had data yet to confirm idea that small moons are rotating chaotically he said not yet
Haha had to put down the microphone in order to talk with his hands to explain Pluto magnetosphere
Stern Alice instrument REX and SWAP have not yet detected the system but that what we expected LEISA has been detecting amp for weeks
Alan Stern divulges the fact that he took geology twice and quit because he found it too much memorization and not enough math
Alan Stern for both Pluto and Charon we see evidence that these are worlds that have at different points in their history been active
Several people have said today they expect first signal at EDT on Tue which differs from NASA media predict of
Chris Hersman mission systems engineer is giving us an update on navigation status TL DR everything is great
Weaver We just had some data come in today and it already looking spectacular but it going to get times better
Weaver We re already seeing lot of similarities with Triton it almost eerie
Dang none of these are lining up yet NewHorizonsBingo
huge loss
That women of New Horizons photo makes me happy but also sad about its lack of ethnic diversity We still have lot of work to do
asks about next Kuiper belt object to visit Green answers we may not have to go so far could visit Triton or Trojan asteroids
Green NASA position is simple We do not care what this object is called it an object well worth observing
Jim Green is now tearing up as he remembers and honors Claudia Alexander
Media center is already hopping for flyby Many international space journalists already here
Reporting for duty from Kossiakoff center
Any dots you see between Pluto amp Charon in NH pics are either stars in background or cosmic ray hits on detector
Because LORRI has no color filters it is panchromatic Color data will be provided later by different instrument
Zooming in to Pluto and Charon
Pluto god of the underworld
An amazing and inspiring BlackAndStem scientist has died The world is poorer place tonight
Since lot of people are asking they didn colorize the latest pics of Pluto because the color data they have is old thus VERY low res
Pluto has stopped looking like Mars and now really really looks like Titan But half the size

And of course years ago Eris was Xena Makemake was Easterbunny Haumea was Santa It took me long time to start using the real names
Haumea was announced yrs ago yesterday fastest spinning large body in solar system Multiple moons Family of collisional fragments Wow
Makemake was announced on the same day as Eris years ago Surface is covered in slabs of methane Awesome place Let go
Things we ve learned If Eris had been at its closest point to the sun Clyde Tombaugh would likely have discovered it yrs ago
Things we ve learned about Eris in yrs its surface reflects almost of the sunlight that hits it because of that frozen atmosphere
Things we ve learned about Eris in yrs its orbit is inclined by degrees to the plane of the planets Which still doesn make sense
Things we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has satellite Dysnomia that we think was formed in giant impact Maybe
Things we ve learned about Eris in yrs it is much more massive than Pluto yet tiny bit smaller thus much rockier on the inside
Things we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has very Pluto like surface composition though at the distance the atmosphere is frozen
yrs ago today Lilah was days old And we announced the discovery of Eris Lilah was not pleased that was gone all day Sorry Lilah
People will continue ground based observations of the atmosphere over the next years and would bet it is still there mostly the same
hate to be the voice of Pluto sobriety or any sobriety but that whole Pluto atmosphere has collapsed in year thing smells fishy
Yay More Charon My current explanation huh
So are the mountains and the big ice mound somehow related Not obvious how But Hmmmm Or perhaps just seeing things Again
Also interesting to me in the full Pluto image don think see anymore spiky mountains like the ones in the SW of Tombaugh
Anybody else think the two big craters on the left are from the impact of near contact binary KBO
Other places likely to have cool CH flows Makemake Eris Quaoar OR Fun to see Pluto to better understand these too
In my view the ice flows are the coolest things found on Pluto so far Still want more Charon though
Sounds like people have water on Mars style press release fatigue Hard to blame them really
Just interview by BBC presenter about Kepler who said look haven we more or less heard all of this before And um yeah kinda
As mentioned earlier today this is thoroughly awesome On reflection it remains awesome
love to see more of that dark terrain on Pluto THAT where we ll learn whether or not there is internal activity think Soon Ish
Ah Plenty of craters on Pluto where they re not covered by ices Which is of course what was expected all along
Haze in the craters of Ceres OK That counts as awesome
Happy to see my favorite wikipedia dwarf planet image updated so quickly
OK Pluto That was fun Now back to work Today Europa Trojan asteroids And super secret project with the code name Phattie
Awesomeness
It ice volcanoes all the way down
think we have winner
So what good word for frost moving around on surface to distinguish from geological activity My brain is failing to get one
Also worth noting that geologically active generally means interior rumblings Clearly frosts move around on Pluto surface
Most are also hoping that Pluto is active just want better evidence If it true we ll know soon Also if not
In current hallway conversations with planetary scientists most are unconvinced by the evidence that Pluto is geologically active
BBC Newsday Right Now
wife opens wines pours me glass thanks honey
ok hard to argue with this one
Sure it OK to grandfather Pluto in as planet Also you can grandfather the Earth as flat too if that makes you feel better
ll be there at the Planetary Society thing tonight listening for the NH signal Come say hi Throw ice or something
If you re local amp looking for place to geek out on Pluto tonight come to the Planetary Society event in Pasadena
Every time someone says Pluto looks really interesting thus should be planet Titan sheds an alkane tear
Or maybe not Figuring out if that is plausible requires getting out the pencil and doing calculations Which too sleepy to do now
equatorial ice melting decades earlier Once it starts it spreads around the equator Leaving the heart for last
Is it coincidence that the heart is on the anti Charon side Maybe light from Charon provided just enough extra heat to start the
My best is that if you came back in years the heart would be gone which sounds kind of sad and dark regions would extend further
BUT the bright patch really shouldnt be at the equator That one of the warmest spots The rest of the equator is ice free as expected
Not surprising to have ice patches coming and going Pluto goes through seasonal temperature extremes so that is expected
That heart on Pluto sure is odd It appears to be thick ice patch that is being slowing eaten away at the edges
So apparently my autocorrexts changes autocorrexts to autocorrexts Automatically
Also the dark patch at Charon north pole definitely looks more interesting than initially gave it credit for
Watch Charon probably the most similar thing in the solar system to Orcus at least on the surface
Ohhh crater rays on Charon Awesome And might the tiny white splotches be my ice volcanoes want ice volcanoes
Useful to keep in mind Pluto size and density in the context of other objects from the Kuiper belt
Hey so is it too early to suggest that the big heart on Pluto whatever it turns out to be be named Tombaugh
Back in offered these thoughts on the critical question of whether Eris or Pluto is bigger on
Odd that Eris is tiny bit smaller than Pluto but so much more massive They are quite different bodies in many ways Maybe we should go
good sign would be that Charon pole is not just darker but also red think we ll get color info soon
Pluto still pretty inscrutable at this distance More resolution please oh you will thanks
endorse
month ago suggested Charon would look like Uranus moon Ariel Similarities pretty good so far
Yay got my Charon craters Now where are my ice flow plains
We re approaching the summer solstice after which most of the northern ices might have headed south Process already starting now
In the fig the solid line shows the latitude of the sun time the dark regions show where the ice has evaporated white is ice
Here figure from that Hansen amp Paige paper showing how Pluto surface ices move around with time
Even now that about all can say Amazing how fast this is all going to come and go and how much we will wish we saw but didn
On Charon the brightest spots are likely to be ammonia rich water ice flows Dark spots not dark just lack of water flows
OK what about Charon Still too low detail want craters damnit And want them now But will have to wait
Conclusions even at this range it is really really hard to learn details of what is going on here Recommendation Go closer
of that sort Your eye is good at playing tricks on you suspect that on the nicely imaged side you ll see no giant polygons
What are the polygonal features Not polygons Seems unlikely any physical process could form large scale linear features cont
evaporating and going poleward Come back in years and it might look just like the equator Again nicely modeled in Hansen amp Paige
North of the dark equator are the patchy tropics Summer has started here recently so suspect this is where ice is currently cont
Still weird that it is at equator Maybe something interesting going on there Keep your eye out
The heart could just be random feedback It bright so reflects sunlight so cold so gets icy gets brighter gets colder etc
Why is the dark equatorial band not continuous No clue The heart looks like the brightest spot on the surface and its equatorial
dark substrate behind Dark substrate is probably tholins Tholins organic muck sorry
by Hansen and Paige who showed how nitrogen evaporates from the warm equatorial regions and reaccumulates at the poles leaving cont
The dominant feature on Pluto is the dark but not quite continuous equatorial band This was nicely explained in in paper cont
OK friends the Pluto and Charon images are good enough for new round of speculation Let start here
do another round of Pluto image speculation but soon we reach the intersection of speculation and information ll wait Just little
The latest Pluto images remind me of early adaptive optics images of Titan totally cool and thoroughly uninterpretable Soon though Soon
Just back from vacation What all of this Pluto stuff everyone is talking about
Biggest Pluto surprise to me so far is that New Horizons still hasn spotted any new moons have bet yes
so far nothing on pluto Charon to be surprised about But images are quickly getting better Stay tuned
Charon looks grayer because it too small to keep nitrogen or methane from escaping so only has old water ice on its surface
peach relatively fresh methane starting to degrade Dark old warm ice free degraded methane
on Pluto darker spots get warmer drove off ices get warmer still drive off more ices etc etc So white cold nitrogen ice
methane breaks apart and turns reddish when exposed to sunlight and space Pluto is patchy probably because of feedback
Time for your periodic Pluto speculations So far all is as expected Pluto is peach colored because of methane

Fun way to start vacation evacuation of LAX terminal for smoking bag Which then explodes NoSmokingArea
love what do But even more love vacation with my family Which starts now bye
Pluto likely mottled because of surface feedback slightly darker areas get warmer drive off ices get darker get warmer get darker
Why is Pluto so mottled looking Deconvolution will make it appear more so than it really is but we know that it really IS
Why don we see such ice on Pluto Likely there just covered in CH CO frosts amp might be morphologically similar under the frost
Where do ice flows on Charon come from The ancient interior ocean now frozen out but once erupting onto the surface
Dark polar cap on Charon Unlikely to be dark ice frost cap but rather lack of bright stuff What is bright stuff Ice flows
Now with that first go read this and then let do some idle speculation

In case you were worried actually like the real non planet Pluto
Apparently there are those looking at you Carolina who think there should be MUSTARD in pulled pork sauce These people must be stopped
ICYMI my speculations yesterday on the latest Pluto images have been Storyfyed
the water ammonia would have erupted out onto the surface making it look perhaps like Ariel the satellite of Uranus That my bet
Truth is more excited to see Charon suspect it will look something like this
think we ve got some polar caps as expected The dark areas South at longitude look like the expected organic rich spots
First step read little of what we think is on Pluto Even in we had some ideas start around Figure
not involved in New Horizons so am free to do purely speculative geological interpretaiton starting NOW
As of today the silly term Plutoid has been used in precisely zero titles or abstracts of refereed papers

Sorry mean all going smoothly at Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea here tonight Spectacular place to be spying on the universe
zong just found this thing that helps you stay awake at night its called coffee my friends and ill sell you some for one zillion dollars
It been interesting being here on the big Island listening to people about Mauna Kea The NYT is nicely balanced
One hour until sunset on Mauna Kea Then we ll open up the Keck telescope and begin to understand the solar system little bit better
Nice byproduct of observing Europa with Keck is this sweet little image of Jupiter in the guide camera
apparently trying to stay up all night at the telescope and having food poisoning are not things that go well together who knew

To get to Haumea you go sunward st because you go FAST when by the sun then fire your engines and then Oberth
The cool part is that Haumea and Makemake are relatively close to each other so you could send tiny sub probe to visit Makemake too
sad to say that the mission to Haumea takes years Not to get from the earth to the sun more to get the other of the way
Fun to be in meeting with rockets scientists they say things like oh no that not good idea you probably explode And they mean it

The sky is brightening here on Mauna Kea and we re closing down We just covered more sky than in the entire first decade of KBO searches
First day of fall or as like to think of it the moment when the opposition ecliptic heads into the north celestial hemisphere
The galaxies in this neck of the sky are pretty though they really do get in the way of the interesting stuff
When said big camera meant BIG This is the CAMERA There is whole telescope in front of it
with this huge camera on this huge telescope and these nice skies we should have the record for most KBO discoveries in night by dawn
Every time we open up the telescope and take minute exposure we discover something like new objects in the Kuiper belt
hr to Mauna Kea sunset Tonight we re looking for tiny ice balls beyond Neptune Which kind of makes me sound like broken record
