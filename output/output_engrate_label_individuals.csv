New Horizons covers million km per day and it still took years to get to Pluto And here we are gaping at pictures it took,HRT
But what drove those Pluto mountains upward This is critical question not what there but how it got there,HRT
On Pluto water ice is so cold it harder than rock Makes for good mountain building Smaller than Rockies but Pluto lt Earth,HRT
PLUTO CHARON Wow Wow Humanity first look at the frontier of the solar system,HRT
Pluto has mountains of water ice coated with thin surface of methane and nitrogen ice Alien world indeed,HRT
What could be driving surfacing amp mtn formation No tides from nearby planet and it tidally locked with Charon,HRT

McNutt We have been awarded hours of director discretionary time on Chandra to look for solar wind charged rays,ART
Ralph McNutt is talking and and are not here to take notes so will have to serve,LRT
User ZLD has morphed the MVIC color image onto the LORRI grayscale image,HRT
These may have been up for while already but just noticed that the last opnavs are on the raws page,ART
Poor,ART
Welp seem to have come to the notice of certain just told him we have lot of the solar system left to explore,ART
Charlene Christy It wonderful having waited all this time to finally get to see Charon,ART
Showalter We re not really finished searching for sixth moon of Pluto but if it there it really small,HRT
Awwww via,HRT
is now on the spacecraft pointing at Earth to PHONE HOME Signal takes hours to get here,HRT
Here recording of my segment on on today,ART
worthy Monty Python reference,ART
Christy You start with Charlene and you take the ene off and put an on on,HRT
According to Jim Christy the correct pronunciation is sharr rhymes with bar on like the word on,HRT
An epic panel beginning now Pluto Moon Discovery Team Jim Christy Charon Hal Weaver Nix amp Hydra Mark Showalter Kerberos,ART
Moore is recalling the Mariner approach images of Mars where scientists published about the km crater at Nix Olympica,HRT
Jeff Moore wouldn say Charon is as interesting as Pluto Not that there anything wrong with it Spencer It perfectly fine moon,HRT
Poor geology team has been too busy talking about the images to media to sit down and study the geology,ART
Spencer is explaining how thermal segregation may explain contrast between light and dark terrains on Pluto as on Iapetus and Callisto,ART
Much of the geology team on New Horizons were grad students together on Voyager so they like to give each other hard time,HRT
Basically yes,LRT
Spencer We have the opportunity to fine tune when high res images are played back depending on what we see in lower res images,ART
John Spencer This part looks like Mars if you ignore the temperature and the composition and everything else,HRT
As Grunsfeld likes to say science never sleeps aside Science would like to sleep now,HRT
Here are the informal names being used for dark spots suggested by public campaign organized by,HRT
lot of the time that how science ideas happen someone poses question you have to think of an answer fast and there it is,ART
am having parallel processing problems in my brain so please just read streams,LRT
guess Tweet takes the place of the traditional phone call these days,HRT
Atmospheric science result,HRT
Cathy Olkin From the ground we knew there were lot of different colors on Pluto but we never imagined anything like this,HRT
Here is the MVIC color data hope pics will make it online soon Charon pole is red,HRT
The not planets all those round worlds we ve visited to scale,HRT
My Twitter silence is because of interviews group pictures etc but had chance to tell Jim Green what thought of what Grunsfeld said,ART
Going to be on shortly about PDT to talk about,ART
Yes Look what Churyumov Gerasimenko looked like up close can even imagine what others are like,ART
As always there an XKCD for that,ART
think that the most dangerous possible thing to say about Pluto flyby that with it we re somehow done with the solar system We re not,HRT
Word,ART
Oh this don agree with How about the whole rest of the Kuiper belt Eris Makemake Haumea Sedna Orcus,HRT
would just like to take moment to thank and for your awesome tweeting amp notetaking from the panels,ART
And now have to stop listening to Pluto geologists for few minutes to go do standup for the BBC PlutoFlyby,ART
Bonnie Buratti We have been monitoring from Earth what we now know is the heart on Pluto for years,HRT
Bagenal Pluto looked remarkably like Mars Much better than Mars though,HRT
Fran Bagenal says it unlikely New Horizons will reach interstellar space it going slower than Voyagers,HRT
Just had an opportunity to congratulate Marc Buie on the quality of his pre New Horizons Hubble maps of Pluto,HRT
Rosetta looked at Pluto too,HRT
It seems that years of being mom and months of working at home during home remodel have prepared me well to tune out distractions,ART
New Horizons best look at Pluto before close approach,HRT
Found the full res am working on posting it,ART
still haven found the new picture in full res on website only the low res version on Instagram,ART
Bowman We were seconds early Stern Our nav predicts came out to km closer to Pluto than aimpoint Well within spec PlutoFlyby,HRT
Dwayne Brown is passing American flags out to the panelists,ART
Right now all images are being returned with JPEG like lossy compression We will get lossless ones eventually,HRT
Stern To my eye these pictures show younger surface on Pluto and much older and more battered surface on Charon PlutoFlyby,HRT
Grunsfeld to Bowman What is the actual data rate think it lower than Bowman Yeah we wish it was PlutoFlyby,HRT
asked if the new image showed evidence of hazes or clouds Stern replied he looked and hadn seen those or plumes yet,HRT
XKCD What if What if New Horizons hit my car,HRT
Joel Achenbach asked my question so figured ask question for all you Pluto weather fans out there,LRT
As sitting in front row lot of photographers are shooting over my laptop with Pluto image on it to desk Stern amp Bowman,ART
There is lot of applause happening but it feels premature until we hear from New Horizons again,HRT
Since it FAQ It will be hours until we hear from New Horizons because spacecraft is too busy scienceing to talk to us right now,HRT
Press briefing coming up momentarily But still hours until we find out whether New Horizons survived flyby or not,HRT
Closest approach PlutoFlyby,HRT
They are playing The Final Countdown,HRT
No there is not,ART
This is happening outside the press room and off NASA TV and not sure why,HRT
Bowman We had lot of activity in the mission operations center last night with DSN antennas uplinking to New Horizons am,ART

Pluto continues to surprise us and Charon is surprising,ART
Yay is here to tell us what wow wow means,ART
Choice of target will be made in August think Course correction in November Extended mission approval in,HRT
It should hit the ground at EDT but no idea how long it will take for public release predict morning,ART

Pluto hat Another newhorizonsbingo square,HRT
YOU RE KILLING MEEEEEEE,ART
Pluto minus day Very first New Horizons Pluto encounter science results Pluto diameter composition atmosphere,HRT
Thanks for the primer on atmospheric escape processes,LRT
All right we actually got some science news in that briefing so going to shut down twitter for bit to write about it,ART
Briefing over,LRT
Stern These first compositional measurements show us that the polar regions are compositionally very different from the dark regions,HRT
Stern People love turning little dots little points of light into planets and writing new textbooks from scratch,HRT
Stern Particularly for children Pluto is dimunutive and they re diminutive there an association there,ART
Stern There no single reason people love Pluto There lot of different reasons,ART
Grunsfeld Pluto is capstone of our solar system exploration and also it opening up new realm,HRT
Stern explains color data is much more expensive in terms of bits to get it to the ground which is why more LORRI pics have come down,HRT
Cathy Olkin promises new color images tomorrow,ART
Blerg Yes,LRT
Stern People on the team talk lot about how surreal it is that we re actually finally here But the energy level is electric,ART
Stern New Horizons cruise is not record Rosetta set record But Rosetta had many flybys so didn seem like interminable road trip,ART
Stern SDC hears all the thruster findings so we have to change the squelch level so we quiet down the racket from the thrusters,ART
Eris is bright and super far away hence cold When it is much closer to the Sun it prob has Pluto like atmosphere,ART
Stern We tested techniques we used to determine Pluto diameter on Charon and got the right answer radius km,HRT
Yes let,ART
Stern was interrupted by Siri on somebody phone just now,LRT
note has just been passed to Grunsfeld who passed it to Stern who nodded and passed it to Fountain whatcoulditbe,ART
understand you have to put miles on graphics for Americans but for love of Pete why can you also put metric measurements,HRT
Stern We detected escaping nitrogen before expected Either escaping faster than we thought or mechanism is different than thought,HRT
Stern Pluto radius is km It settles the debate about the largest object in the Kuiper belt,HRT
Stern It sounds like science fiction but it not fills out one of my NewHorizonsBingo squares,ART
PSA will not respond to any questions comments about Pluto planetary status That is least interesting thing to discuss at PlutoFlyby,HRT
They re simulating Pluto temperatures in press room and shivering but if put on jacket will cover my awesome shirt spacegeekprobs,ART
Schenk there lot of speculation flying around team right now but we recognize most of it as being ephemeral PlutoFlyby,ART

Hal Weaver help to bridge the gaps between the scientists and their science speak and the engineers and their engineering speak,ART
Dang none of these are lining up yet NewHorizonsBingo,HRT
huge loss,ART
That women of New Horizons photo makes me happy but also sad about its lack of ethnic diversity We still have lot of work to do,HRT
asks Green if he was referring to proposed Discovery Trojan mission Green says no he has not looked at Discovery proposals yet,ART
asks about next Kuiper belt object to visit Green answers we may not have to go so far could visit Triton or Trojan asteroids,ART
Green NASA position is simple We do not care what this object is called it an object well worth observing,HRT
oh god why you gotta ask about planetary status,LRT
Somebody asks Green about extended mission be willing to bet that the team is not focused on that at the moment,ART
Jim Green is now tearing up as he remembers and honors Claudia Alexander,ART

Welcome back to earth You ve done us proud,HRT
Roman looks great Pulling others out now,HRT
Touchdown We are celebrating,HRT
Crew doesn know exactly when touchdown will occur Must brace themselves early close their jaws and wait for the impact,HRT
About min till touchdown,HRT
Don be fooled by the term soft landing thrusters They are basically explosives that fire at to slow the Soyuz,HRT
Roman is calling condition of spacecraft over radio Mentioned the seats shock absorbers have extended ready to absorb extreme ldg shock,HRT
This is the best part Seeing good parachute and hearing the crew over the radio,HRT

Here you go MT Intervu the brilliant abt the Arecibo Message th annivrary at Thu,ART
Back from taping BBC intrvu Will be broadcast on the th annivrsry of Arecibo Message Nov Ask Adam what station,ART
And now gotta run amp do BBC radio interview about the th anniversary of the Arecibo message Catch you all later,ART
They just announced lander is on the surface and Philae is talking to them,HRT
SO happy for ESA and the Rosetta team CONGRATULATIONS All your hard work is now rewarded Enjoy and we will with you,HRT
They re clapping,HRT
Shouldn we have heard by now,ART
Philae on its way,HRT
So stoked In just few hrs Rosetta Philae lander will attempt to land on comet via,HRT
Not one but SIX GENERALS in,ART
Now for commercial break From hours of NYC walking by Princess Leia So good,HRT
FINALLY Lieut Gen speaks truth amp not the usual nonsense platittudes abt valor amp honor on this VeteransDay,HRT
And back here on Earth MT Russia will build up to new nuclear reactors in Iran for atomic energy,ART
This cartoon Part of Rosetta CometLanding is so well done Congrats to ESA for an outstanding job Gd Luck,HRT
THE most fantastic Rosetta image yet It calls to mind the art of Chesley Bonestell Ice climbing anyone,HRT

Best camp pic Lilah in wrestling match smiling like crazy hope they teach her an arm bar,LRT
New kittens will be great but can replace our big orange cat Ike who passed away in May mean that literally He was like lbs,LRT
Side effects of Lilah at camp get LOT more work done eat better food We re gonna get kittens don tell Lilah,LRT
Day of Lilah at sleep away camp Pictures received Unambiguous smiles during multiple activities OK OK OK can relax now OK OK,LRT
Group meeting today Colorful Hildas Still no sign of Mania Cool new Europa data is not quite ready to see Phinding Phattie,LRT
Day of Lilah at sleep away camp Pictures arrive She smiling Right That smile Isn it Wait What if she frowning Is that,LRT
reload still no pix this is worse than waiting for new horizons images of pluto to be posted,LRT
Lilah is away at her st ever sleep away camp They post pix but none yet My reload button is worn out,LRT
OMG can type the word plants without it coming out planets Which just happened right now too,HRT
Our drought magic trick Over the past yrs we slowly replaced grass with native planets Which look better Go us notactuallystinky,HRT
Just ran the numbers Our house water usage is down since before the drought started Go us Also we stink little sometimes,ART
And of course years ago Eris was Xena Makemake was Easterbunny Haumea was Santa It took me long time to start using the real names,HRT
So yrs ago today was pretty exciting day was on the Today show With Lilah Which was nice so my mom could see her for st time,ART
Haumea was announced yrs ago yesterday fastest spinning large body in solar system Multiple moons Family of collisional fragments Wow,HRT
Makemake was announced on the same day as Eris years ago Surface is covered in slabs of methane Awesome place Let go,HRT
Things we ve learned If Eris had been at its closest point to the sun Clyde Tombaugh would likely have discovered it yrs ago,HRT
Things we ve learned about Eris in yrs its surface reflects almost of the sunlight that hits it because of that frozen atmosphere,HRT
Things we ve learned about Eris in yrs its orbit is inclined by degrees to the plane of the planets Which still doesn make sense,HRT
Things we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has satellite Dysnomia that we think was formed in giant impact Maybe,HRT
Things we ve learned about Eris in yrs it is much more massive than Pluto yet tiny bit smaller thus much rockier on the inside,HRT
Things we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has very Pluto like surface composition though at the distance the atmosphere is frozen,HRT
yrs ago today Lilah was days old And we announced the discovery of Eris Lilah was not pleased that was gone all day Sorry Lilah,ART
People will continue ground based observations of the atmosphere over the next years and would bet it is still there mostly the same,ART
hate to be the voice of Pluto sobriety or any sobriety but that whole Pluto atmosphere has collapsed in year thing smells fishy,HRT
Yay More Charon My current explanation huh,ART
So are the mountains and the big ice mound somehow related Not obvious how But Hmmmm Or perhaps just seeing things Again,ART
Also interesting to me in the full Pluto image don think see anymore spiky mountains like the ones in the SW of Tombaugh,ART
Anybody else think the two big craters on the left are from the impact of near contact binary KBO,HRT
Other places likely to have cool CH flows Makemake Eris Quaoar OR Fun to see Pluto to better understand these too,HRT
In my view the ice flows are the coolest things found on Pluto so far Still want more Charon though,HRT
Sounds like people have water on Mars style press release fatigue Hard to blame them really,ART
Just interview by BBC presenter about Kepler who said look haven we more or less heard all of this before And um yeah kinda,HRT
As mentioned earlier today this is thoroughly awesome On reflection it remains awesome,HRT
love to see more of that dark terrain on Pluto THAT where we ll learn whether or not there is internal activity think Soon Ish,HRT
Ah Plenty of craters on Pluto where they re not covered by ices Which is of course what was expected all along,HRT
Also if understand IAU rules correctly but does anyone if we still don get around to naming OR by its up for grabs,ART
Haze in the craters of Ceres OK That counts as awesome,HRT
Happy to see my favorite wikipedia dwarf planet image updated so quickly,HRT
OK Pluto That was fun Now back to work Today Europa Trojan asteroids And super secret project with the code name Phattie,HRT
Awesomeness,HRT
It ice volcanoes all the way down,HRT
think we have winner,HRT
So what good word for frost moving around on surface to distinguish from geological activity My brain is failing to get one,HRT
Also worth noting that geologically active generally means interior rumblings Clearly frosts move around on Pluto surface,HRT
Most are also hoping that Pluto is active just want better evidence If it true we ll know soon Also if not,HRT
In current hallway conversations with planetary scientists most are unconvinced by the evidence that Pluto is geologically active,HRT
BBC Newsday Right Now,ART
wife opens wines pours me glass thanks honey,ART
Going to be live on the BBC in hours Which is morning there But is making me pondering whether or not to open this bottle of wine,ART
ok hard to argue with this one,HRT
Sure it OK to grandfather Pluto in as planet Also you can grandfather the Earth as flat too if that makes you feel better,HRT
ll be there at the Planetary Society thing tonight listening for the NH signal Come say hi Throw ice or something,HRT
If you re local amp looking for place to geek out on Pluto tonight come to the Planetary Society event in Pasadena,HRT
Every time someone says Pluto looks really interesting thus should be planet Titan sheds an alkane tear,HRT
Or maybe not Figuring out if that is plausible requires getting out the pencil and doing calculations Which too sleepy to do now,HRT
equatorial ice melting decades earlier Once it starts it spreads around the equator Leaving the heart for last,HRT
Is it coincidence that the heart is on the anti Charon side Maybe light from Charon provided just enough extra heat to start the,HRT
My best is that if you came back in years the heart would be gone which sounds kind of sad and dark regions would extend further,HRT
BUT the bright patch really shouldnt be at the equator That one of the warmest spots The rest of the equator is ice free as expected,HRT
Not surprising to have ice patches coming and going Pluto goes through seasonal temperature extremes so that is expected,HRT
That heart on Pluto sure is odd It appears to be thick ice patch that is being slowing eaten away at the edges,HRT
So apparently my autocorrexts changes autocorrexts to autocorrexts Automatically,ART
Also the dark patch at Charon north pole definitely looks more interesting than initially gave it credit for,HRT
Watch Charon probably the most similar thing in the solar system to Orcus at least on the surface,HRT
Ohhh crater rays on Charon Awesome And might the tiny white splotches be my ice volcanoes want ice volcanoes,HRT
Useful to keep in mind Pluto size and density in the context of other objects from the Kuiper belt,HRT
Hey so is it too early to suggest that the big heart on Pluto whatever it turns out to be be named Tombaugh,HRT
Back in offered these thoughts on the critical question of whether Eris or Pluto is bigger on,HRT
Odd that Eris is tiny bit smaller than Pluto but so much more massive They are quite different bodies in many ways Maybe we should go,HRT
good sign would be that Charon pole is not just darker but also red think we ll get color info soon,HRT
Lilah thinks the bright craters on Charon might be ice volcanoes She listened to too many of my phone interviews,ART
Pluto still pretty inscrutable at this distance More resolution please oh you will thanks,HRT
endorse,HRT
month ago suggested Charon would look like Uranus moon Ariel Similarities pretty good so far,HRT
Yay got my Charon craters Now where are my ice flow plains,ART
We re approaching the summer solstice after which most of the northern ices might have headed south Process already starting now,HRT
In the fig the solid line shows the latitude of the sun time the dark regions show where the ice has evaporated white is ice,HRT
Here figure from that Hansen amp Paige paper showing how Pluto surface ices move around with time,HRT
Even now that about all can say Amazing how fast this is all going to come and go and how much we will wish we saw but didn,HRT
On Charon the brightest spots are likely to be ammonia rich water ice flows Dark spots not dark just lack of water flows,HRT
OK what about Charon Still too low detail want craters damnit And want them now But will have to wait,HRT
Conclusions even at this range it is really really hard to learn details of what is going on here Recommendation Go closer,HRT
of that sort Your eye is good at playing tricks on you suspect that on the nicely imaged side you ll see no giant polygons,HRT
What are the polygonal features Not polygons Seems unlikely any physical process could form large scale linear features cont,HRT
evaporating and going poleward Come back in years and it might look just like the equator Again nicely modeled in Hansen amp Paige,HRT
North of the dark equator are the patchy tropics Summer has started here recently so suspect this is where ice is currently cont,HRT
Still weird that it is at equator Maybe something interesting going on there Keep your eye out,ART
The heart could just be random feedback It bright so reflects sunlight so cold so gets icy gets brighter gets colder etc,HRT
Why is the dark equatorial band not continuous No clue The heart looks like the brightest spot on the surface and its equatorial,HRT
dark substrate behind Dark substrate is probably tholins Tholins organic muck sorry,HRT
by Hansen and Paige who showed how nitrogen evaporates from the warm equatorial regions and reaccumulates at the poles leaving cont,HRT
The dominant feature on Pluto is the dark but not quite continuous equatorial band This was nicely explained in in paper cont,HRT
OK friends the Pluto and Charon images are good enough for new round of speculation Let start here,HRT
do another round of Pluto image speculation but soon we reach the intersection of speculation and information ll wait Just little,ART
The latest Pluto images remind me of early adaptive optics images of Titan totally cool and thoroughly uninterpretable Soon though Soon,HRT
Just back from vacation What all of this Pluto stuff everyone is talking about,HRT
Happy Birthday to my favorite year old Pariselfie OnedecadeofLilah,LRT

Tour de France Stage time trial Utrecht Temperature OMGWTFSTFU but no thunderstorms Fingers crossed,LRT
Happy Independence Day American tweeps We re representing here on the water in Utrecht,LRT
Unintentional that photo tweeted few hours ago shows Sunday Tour de France route Visible from our top deck We might be swimming,LRT
Arrived in Utrecht Needed to cool down One obvious solution,LRT
Biggest Pluto surprise to me so far is that New Horizons still hasn spotted any new moons have bet yes,HRT
Lilah being California girl was freaked out by the lightning Me being an Alabama boy found it awesome Diane Neutral,LRT
That your pluto update for today coming from our bost mooring in Montfoort Netherlands Recent site of an epic lightning storm,LRT
so far nothing on pluto Charon to be surprised about But images are quickly getting better Stay tuned,HRT
Charon looks grayer because it too small to keep nitrogen or methane from escaping so only has old water ice on its surface,HRT
peach relatively fresh methane starting to degrade Dark old warm ice free degraded methane,HRT
on Pluto darker spots get warmer drove off ices get warmer still drive off more ices etc etc So white cold nitrogen ice,HRT
methane breaks apart and turns reddish when exposed to sunlight and space Pluto is patchy probably because of feedback,HRT
Time for your periodic Pluto speculations So far all is as expected Pluto is peach colored because of methane,HRT
couldn capture good pic of Jupiter Venus so present to you Diane boat deck full moon beer Gouda,ART

Since we re in Europe for Lilah th Bday asked what she wanted to do Go to Paris duh she said So duh we ll go FingerWrapped,ART
In Amsterdam this weekend wife yr old daughter Tips Advice Suggestions Best bets For gods sake dont go theres,LRT
That all see to speculate on right now But it only gets better,LRT
Pluto likely mottled because of surface feedback slightly darker areas get warmer drive off ices get darker get warmer get darker,HRT
Why is Pluto so mottled looking Deconvolution will make it appear more so than it really is but we know that it really IS,HRT
Why don we see such ice on Pluto Likely there just covered in CH CO frosts amp might be morphologically similar under the frost,ART
Where do ice flows on Charon come from The ancient interior ocean now frozen out but once erupting onto the surface,HRT
Dark polar cap on Charon Unlikely to be dark ice frost cap but rather lack of bright stuff What is bright stuff Ice flows,HRT
Now with that first go read this and then let do some idle speculation,ART
Pro tip for New Horizons images of Pluto amp Charon be wary of sharpened and deconvolved images Don believe stuff unless in raw ones,HRT

Also ate lot of pulled pork With vinegar sauce as one should do thank you very much IsaidNoTomatoes,LRT
Because it was an awesome summer day got involved in long discussion experiments on the correct sauce for pulled pork NoTomatoesEver,ART
ICYMI my speculations yesterday on the latest Pluto images have been Storyfyed,HRT
This extended speculation brought to you courtesy of flight delay OAK gt BUR,ART
the water ammonia would have erupted out onto the surface making it look perhaps like Ariel the satellite of Uranus That my bet,ART
we hypothesized that the ammonia came from an interior ocean where it acted like antifreeze As the ocean slowly froze,ART
But hey let talk Charon for minute yrs ago we detected ammonia ice which was unexpected But,ART
That all ve got for now but stay tuned to this space for more unauthorized speculation Some of which might even turn out to be correct,ART
Truth is more excited to see Charon suspect it will look something like this,HRT
The kinda dark areas at high latitudes don know what those are or why they are there Keeping my eye on them,LRT
The bright areas should be nitrogen methane ices At the equators these sublime decompose and get darker and darker Recondense at poles,ART
think we ve got some polar caps as expected The dark areas South at longitude look like the expected organic rich spots,ART
First step read little of what we think is on Pluto Even in we had some ideas start around Figure,HRT
not involved in New Horizons so am free to do purely speculative geological interpretaiton starting NOW,HRT
If you run fast you can still make it to my talk at WWDC in San Francisco in hours Also you might have to evade security,ART

Sorry mean all going smoothly at Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea here tonight Spectacular place to be spying on the universe,ART
zong just found this thing that helps you stay awake at night its called coffee my friends and ill sell you some for one zillion dollars,HRT
It been interesting being here on the big Island listening to people about Mauna Kea The NYT is nicely balanced,HRT
One hour until sunset on Mauna Kea Then we ll open up the Keck telescope and begin to understand the solar system little bit better,HRT
Nice byproduct of observing Europa with Keck is this sweet little image of Jupiter in the guide camera,HRT
Notwithstanding the fact that the summit of Mauna Kea is currently covered in fog think it is going to be great night tonight,LRT
More Keck tonight Less food poisoning On tap Europa Jupiter trojans and the occasional dark asteroid,ART
apparently trying to stay up all night at the telescope and having food poisoning are not things that go well together who knew,ART
When woke up this morning in State College PA wasn convinced it was possible to make it to Keck Obs before sunset Yet here,ART
get the oddest emails from my daughter sometimes,ART
Woke up in State College this morning Talking Europa at Penn State at lunch and dwarf planets after dinner IceRules,ART
AMA on Reddit minutes,HRT
Anyone around Penn State next Tuesday Wanna talk outer solar system Of course you do,ART
all of the overdue reports,LRT
have something on my weeks long to do list that says Deal Europa What does that even mean also have Read all of the emails,ART
doing Reddit AMA on Saturday So you can ask me anything Really Anything at all Wide open Just not about Pluto OK Deal Promise,HRT
have theory that using ice from the dark trailing side of Europa would result in the best gin amp tonic ever like to test that idea,HRT

Each was supposed to be days ride by horse from the next You could safely ride up and down the coast staying in the missions,ART
In addition to the city names there are the ubiquitous El Camino Royal street names The Kings Road was the path between missions,ART

Pallasites are really hard to take pix of Imagine mirror embedded with translucent gems Cause it mostly is,HRT
My online class sent bit of core mantle boundary from shattered miniplanet,HRT
this is why we can have nice things baconoid pboid,ART
potatoid,HRT
Herschel coined aster oid which means star like because asteroids looked like unresolved points Except now they don bloboid,HRT
It kind of crazy that we can just sit here all night at the Keck telescope and take resolved images of Ceres like it nuthin,HRT
Seriously people Ceres of course And no won kill it That would make me serial killer of dwarf planets,HRT
Tonight is the third night in our series at the Keck telescope Guess what we re going to do No seriously Guess,LRT
Second in tonight series observing Ceres through some serious cirrus,ART
The flower girl from my wedding is graduating from high school today Happy graduation Janna sorry stuck in Hawaii also old,LRT
Whoo hoo Ceres We got images We got spectra We got spectral images We got photons with long wavelengths,HRT
The nice thing about observing over your birthday is that the day comes earlier in UT Happy June th UT everyone,ART
Tonight at Keck observatory all Ceres all the time Well ok on one of the telescopes For the first half But yeah all the time,ART
wonder if Ceres is close enough that we could ablate it with Keck laser Well maybe if we turn it up to,ART
Off to Hawaii Tomorrow night Ceres from the Keck telescope ve never looked at something so close before Must wear sunglasses,ART
Our target for the Keck telescope run this week the st discovered dwarf planet Also the st one to get spacecraft visit NotPluto,ART
SciSolSys lectures are done final exam is out grading soon done Soon off to my tiny tropical island But first tomorrow Hawaii,ART
Dinner with view looking north over Manhattan Not bad here at the NY Academy of Science,ART
Here yesterday parked at LAX Flew to JFK Lost car keys somewhere in between Here tomorrow fly to LAX Stare forlornly at my car,ART
Finished the Caltech part of my MOOC Reactions Mixed Some students liked pre recorded video lectures with interactive class some hated,LRT
unmentioned the combination of wood pig and fire is sure indication of intelligent life SciSolSys,HRT
In SciSolSys this week we mentioned how photosynthesis leads to glucose and cellulose and carbohydrates and apple trees and pigs,ART
Hmm If bear takes my trash into the neighbors yard and over his fence should offer to clean his back yard askingforafriend,ART
My friend the bear has returned after yrs to knock over my can on trash night Please return to the woods my friend for your sake,LRT
When my class is going well they re all here engaged in animated discussion with each other and reduced to tweeting likenow,ART
Not gonna hold my breath for spectacular meteor shower Friday night But sure as heck will be awake just in case,ART
Um that was weird and random translation of my all text tweet to all numbers sure you cryptographers know exactly what meant,ART
Um that was weird and random translation of my all text tweet to all numbers sure you cryptographers know exactly what meant,ART
Also Lilah who used to be Team Sky bandwagon girl now has new bike team Jellybelly They don win much bit they re delicisious,LRT
Lilah and got to watch Peter Sagan and the rest of the peloton zoooom through Pasadena today on the Tour of Califronia she says awesome,ART
just finished filming my last video for SciSolSys after starting in January and working non stop martini andanother third,ART
Hey SciSolSys see the color You know what THAT means MT Curiosity drilling,ART
love this article in the NYT about Geoff Marcy And his search for planets And his chickens,ART
First gray hairs spotted on my head Senility imminent Look for tweets about Pluto being planet coming soon,HRT
See Mike Brown travelogue video to the summit of Mauna Kea on Caltech YouTube Channel SciSolSys,ART
ZOMG got to borrow pallasite for today class touching core mantle boundary SciSolSys,HRT
The wikipedia page on asteroid Mikebrown is kind of hilarious They forgot to mention that it oddly inclined too,HRT
That right ladies and gentlemen This week in SciSolSys stars that are perverted um captioner perturbation,ART
nd triathlon this morning st top finish this is kinda fun th among dudes old like me of which ok fine there weren so many,ART
Wow Apparently reported UFO The aliens also wiped my memory after the event,ART
Diane is in Switzerland touring the LHC and all she ll probably bring back for me is lousy Highs boson,ART
Hey SciSolSys Hit paywall trying to read scientific paper Examples from non scientists Email me amy,LRT
Funny to edit my own video lectures amp find myself waxing about how super cool hafnium tungsten data is What am some sort of geochemist,ART
am happy to report that is also ranting against being scared of killer asteroids,ART
As of today of weeks of my online class are filmed It is possible that might survive this after all Not likely But possible,ART
Tonight Diane and are having dinner on the moon For real this time,ART
Dear SciSolSys class sorry you weren on my flight today think we crossed Mars,ART
Take your kids to work at Caltech is about to become TakeYourKidsToWork and have them talked to by Mike Brown day unintendedconsequences,ART
Hey SciSolSys videos for week of class just dropped Even though it is only week You re welcome hardcore planeteers,LRT
And now must go suck it up Because have more talks to give yayme stilltalking,LRT
You know give lot of talks and usually say they re pretty damned good But everyone sucks sometime Today was my day yayme,ART
All request is that the asteroid impact hazard not get extra attention just because SPACE Many less sexy things more important lt rant gt,ART
Note blind luck and extremely low probability of occurence are not the same thing,ART
just finished recording lecture for next week in which rant about the silliness of fretting about asteroid impacts Ranting feels good,ART
For the record Peeps burn better after being soaked in white gas But they do not taste better,HRT
Yep Nothing good at all FormerPeeps fire HappyEaster,HRT
Nothing good is likely to come of this peeps fire HappyEaster,HRT
Until today had no idea that Pluto was bit like female penis,HRT
now spend my weekends watching and editing my own online lectures Dante failed to anticipate this level of hell,ART
Lilah just now for the win love you until the end of numbers you can copy and thus discovers mathematical induction,HRT
Reading Love in the Time of Cholera fabulously and profoundly shattered any delusion had early in life that could ever be novelist,HRT
Perhaps it is just easiest to never expect anything useful of me You will not be disappointed that way,HRT
Dear World desperately trying to keep up with teaching online class to Expect nothing else useful of me this month Or next,ART
Fabulous Romeo amp Juliet at Or as Matilda says love and fate and touch of stupidity,ART
One hour until the thumb biting begins DoYouBiteYourThumbAtUsSir,LRT
enjoyed dining at Alma few weeks ago but LOVED the email just got saying my proposal to use the ALMA radio telescope was accepted,ART
Lilah amp are getting very excited about Romeo amp Juliet at on Sunday,ART
Week of the class is now posted guest lectures from John Grotzinger and topics Mars duh,ART
Week of my free online solar system class is underway Not too late to start,ART
in Destroy your own solar system UCSC solar system game,ART
Me and of my closest friends on Wilshire today for LAs Ciclavia,ART
Oceans on Enceladus Is that covered in my free online class Yup Is there still time to enroll Yup,HRT
yes young man behind the counter will have good one In fact if all goes well may actually have two,ART
We made it safely down the icy mountain after an OK night at the Subaru telescope Should get some sleep Think ll go swim instead,ART
Argh and with that the humidity spikes the dome closes and leave desperate for my exposures,LRT
Here is the full HyperSuprimeCam field with that huge cluster looking tiny tiny,HRT
Accidentally pointed near this cute cluster Now see if you can find it in the full field,ART
And as say that the humidity on Mauna Kea spikes and we are threatened with imminent closure,LRT
In each minute HSC exposure we detect new objects in the Kuiper belt As you might guess am excited about this new instrument,HRT
HyperSuprimeCam covers crazy amount of sky in each shot Check out all of those CCDs,HRT
Praise be the weather gods The clouds have parted humidity has dropped and the Subaru telescope is open for business Stay dry air DRY,ART
Being forever photon starved we re installing snow chains and driving up to Mauna Kea to sit the night out for the am clearing Like we do,ART
Actually this view from the Keck telescope nicely sums up the current conditions And forgot my tele skis grrr,ART
It hard to tell what the weather is on Mauna Kea right now because the web cams are all covered in snow SkiHawaii,HRT
It stopped raining on the telescopes on Mauna Kea snowinginstead Looks like will be doing sleeping rather than astronony tonight,ART
By crack mean um promise won Really Please let me use it The weather however hates me,ART
Tomorrow night get my first crack at Subaru new Hyper SuprimeCam It bigget than an anime character,ART
At the moment am sitting at my desk in Pasadena Tonight will on top of Mauna Kea prepping for the Subaru telescope Weird world,ART
Happy Makemake day Makemake was the last really bright KBO found Nine years ago today EasterBunny,HRT
Apparently keep sending the wrong course link out Try Then you can see the snark In hours,ART
hrs until online class goes live go to lecture where start theme Snarking About NASA Acronyms SANA,ART
Hey In hours the first two weeks of my free online solar system class go live SciSolSys Be there,HRT
The aftershocks clearly have plan think they are heading for the Ontario airport,HRT
Ah earthquake aftershocks How charming,ART
Um need you to deploy the fog blowing away machines at the Mauna Kea summit for Monday night kthkx,LRT
And there is instantly thread on my class discussion forum about whether Pluto should be planet have no one to blame but myself,HRT
So fun to read intros from everyone taking my FREE ONLINE solar system class of continents represented Antarctica where are you,ART
Post earthquake LA ritual call your friends who live near epicenter check on them Our friends Paintings off wall Mirrors fell All OK,ART
OK for context that was in the top ish biggest earthquakes felt in years of living in California,ART
OK help out the seismic hazard folks Did you feel that one,HRT
clear wave and wave Means it was farish away But not too far,ART
holy crap nice earthquake,HRT
Tonight it was family dance party DJ smackdown Diane won God Monkey Robot might be the best song ever written,ART
Got to have nice chat with today told him my convoluted story about Jupiter trojans It involves hydrogen sulfide Really,ART
That intro lecture can be found here Also you get to take poll on why my hair looks green,HRT
If you re tempted to take my free online Solar System class but don know if it the right level for you check out the intro lecture,HRT
Friday present to you my Science of the Solar System free online class is LIVE NOW days early SciSolSys,HRT
Special note to my SciSolSys tweeps class preview actually starts on Friday Shhhhh,ART
OK everyone Can we now all step back and agree that these embargoes on scientific papers are irritating and stupid,HRT
my free online class starts on the Solar System starts Monday What else are you doing next week,HRT
Also wanna learn more about cool things like the new Sednoid You should take my free online class Really,ART
Great discovery of new object in the same region as Sedna Why is this cool Read Sedna back story here,HRT
The seals are getting pretty excited about the outer solar system press releases today springbreak,HRT
Apparently my uninformed speculation is incorrect and lose the bet,ART
Now back to our regularly scheduled spring break,ART
What would make that result exciting Bigger than Eris Would need albedo which would really surprise me Still That my bet,ART
About that ESO announcement It must an occultation result Largest KBO measured size is Varda It had an occ recently so,ART
Dear outer solar system go back to sleep It spring break and Lilah wants to see the pandas at the,ART
Lilah Diane and lt the San Diego Zoo,ART
Ohhh almost makes me feel bad about killing Pluto But honestly get over it,HRT
You are unlikely to be surprised by my FirstTweet,ART
Even if Lilah doesn agree check out the article It has lot of nice science in it by which mean Nice science,ART
Lilah is startled to see me on the front page of the LA Times Then says well it probably not REALY you,ART
Also apropos nothing my pick for March Madness is ADHD followed closely by schizophrenia Though perhaps should have gone with OCD,HRT
hope doesn find anything new for while ve already recorded the lectures for that part of the class MOOCproblems,ART
caltech pasadena Ca Just warning have well deserved reputation for being slow,LRT
For those asking the class is Science of the Solar System and you can sign up it free here SciSolSys,HRT
Under two weeks to go until my class starts on which means straight to the office from the redeye and work work work,ART
Thus ends my weekend at the Keck telescope few good moments but mostly fog and clouds Back to Hawaii in weeks for tSubaru telescope,LRT
OK if we hadn had clouds all night here at Mauna Kea sure our results would have been as groundbreaking as BICEPs Next time,ART
think this counts as the BICEP money shot,HRT
can get into the press site but the BICEP papers are now live,HRT
Fifteen years ago today seems like long time ago Five years ago wrote about it,ART
Also twitter now has login verification via text message which seems like good plan Signed up,ART
Dealing with account hacking is more entertaining that staring at the bottoms of clouds on Mauna Kea But still don do that again,LRT
Ah crap someone sending spam from my account please do not join me for the hottest event around or whatever it says stand by,ART
No chance to watch tonight as am here watching the cosmos instead,HRT
ACK The sun Back to my coffin for the day More tomorrow,ART
Wee little Mercury poking his head out bit before sunrise Kinda of small for planet Hmmmmm,ART
Also while you re looking at the moonbow click on the hr loop and watch it rise from the clouds Not very common sight,ART
It become spectacular night on Mauna Kea Check out the faint moonbow on the cloud camera,ART
Currently observing the trojan asteroid Hektor Out of respect we will not be observing Achilles tonight,HRT
Rain has stopped humidity has dropped Wake up Eyes on the sky By eyes really just mean meter across mirror,ART
The cloud of Trojan asteroids which follows Jupiter in its orbit is just now starting to rise in the sky think just see rain,ART
It currently raining at the summit of Mauna Kea RAINING When does it rain on Mauna Kea Snow sure Ice storm check Fog yes Rain,ART
Our target list tonight includes Hektor Agamemnon and Odysseus Feeling very old school Classical even trojanasteroids,ART
On tap tonight here at me the NIRSPEC instrument and if we re lucky Trojan asteroids,ART
Little jet found big island All good,ART
About to cross the wide Pacific on which now seems like tiny jet with nearly insignificant transponder Looks lonely out there,ART
Might be related to tomorrow fly to Hawaii to use one of the biggest telescopes in the world to observe the underside of clouds Blerg,LRT
it is clear from emails have just sent that am in generally cranky mood tonight If you see message from me duck,LRT
Lilah rereading the end of the Harry Potter series for the th time has not noticed my existence for hours hellooo itsyourDaaaad,ART
Oooooh jealous Orion Death Stars Exterminate Baby Planets vy,ART
Seriously all of that Google searching was for friend Promise,LRT
My Google ads today Children swimming lessons check flights from LAX yup men with low testosterone um um UM WHAT amp,LRT
HEY My free online class The Science of the Solar System starts in weeks Questions Ask me,HRT
When was in high school me and my geeky friends would dissect every moment of Cosmos on Monday morning What re your kids doing tomorrow,HRT
Also when you re done drinking the Comos you might try watching Cosmos,ART
Hey West coast It Comos time The Carl Sagan version is why an astronomer Your kids might say the same in yrs about this one,HRT
Also when Diane is gone for the weekend play music loudly after Lilah is soundly to bed Tonight Counting Crows,LRT
Tonight Diane out of town What to do Steam sea bass for me amp Lilah put her to sleep write data reduction code awesomesaturdaynight,ART
Users interested in reading the article by might also be interested in,ART
Seems all scientists need to tweet opinion of Gravity Me think it great song but Alison Krauss should have sung one more verse,HRT
Finally recovered from trip back from Mauna Kea We had lucky hole in the clouds MK is back to being socked in,LRT
Seriously they shouldn give restaurants the same names as telescopes It confuses people when you talk about them Well Maybe people,ART
Here is my review of Alma better than its predecessors but could improve in resolution and sensitivity still Oh wait That ALMA,LRT
Headed to Alma for dinner tonight Hard to get reservations but not as hard as getting observing time at ALMA,ART
So long Hawaii and thanks for the Trojans Huh That kinda sounds weird,ART
It time for Mauna Kea gt Kona gt LA But ll leaving with my pockets stuffed full of sky Can wait to see what in it,ART
Oh oh It Venus My time here is nearly done,ART
could and do watch this all night Saturn rising in the CFHT cloud cam Milky way sneeks in at the end,HRT
The sun is degrees below the horizon at Mauna Kea so the astronomers now come out to play Less wind tonight more trojans discovered,HRT
or perhaps PLATE TECTONICS Because spelling,ART
Mauna Kea Kohala Big Island Haleakala Maui Three volcanoes All in row Because PLATE TECTONCS,HRT
Just awake in to head back up to Mauna Kea summit was gonna ask what did miss but based on my timeline the answer is obv aurora,ART
Good morning sunshine,ART
Of last night the brightest will have very well measured colors which is what we re really after up here That will do nicely,ART
Sun is coming up here at Mauna Kea estimate that we discovered new Jupiter trojan asteroids last night Tomorrow maaawrrrr,HRT
The high winds have really smeared out the stars tonight good night would have all of those points at or so And gt Yee gads,ART
Those of you who like me are fans of the CFHT Mauna Kea seeing tower measurements will look at this and gasp,ART
Ah we re chewing up so much sky tonight in our trojan asteroid search link you the images but you need ft wide screen,ART
This is an awesome analemma,HRT
Wanna see what all of this crazy Subaru observing ACTUALLY looks like filming it all for my online class,ART
We have telescope We have Astronomical Twilight We have DATA,ART
It officially Nautical Twilight here on Mauna Kea Captains break out the sextants and begin sighting The rest of you carry on,ART
The Subaru telescope is having some glitchess at the start of night They re unplugging it and plugging it back in It really big plug,HRT
Nice thing is that these small fragments will then show us what the big ones are like on the inside Stay tuned,ART
These will be so small that they re probably fragments from catastrophic collisions which broke apart larger trojans,ART
Our goal for the next two nights will be discover few hundred small trojan asteroids out at Jupiter distance,ART
Almost time to head to the summit of Mauna Kea Weather is clear and dry but windy with fuzzy stars We ll take it,LRT
While waiting for sunset spending the afternoon reading about cronstedtite blame and meteorites everywhere,ART
Southern California is about to get its first cracking winter storm in years and ll be out of town and miss it Sad DroughtWorldProblems,ART
Headed up to the summit of Mauna Kea tonight finally This is what we like to see,ART
Hey Titan is cold Its atmosphere stinks You can even skate there Cause solid methane sinks,HRT
Arrived at Hale Pohaku astronomy base camp at ft No Sherpas required Just Hertz rental car,ART
The first part of my Subaru run was success driving the Subaru to the airport Tonight Hale Pohaku Tomorrow Subaru telescope,ART
Also ll be taking the Freeway to the airport and hope to discover new Trojan asteroids at Subaru More coincidences,ART
Tomorrow morning ll be up early to drive my Subaru to the airport to fly to Hawaii to observe on the Subaru telescope Coincidence,ART
Ah Mauna Kea no clouds no fog but high winds and big fuzzy stars OK ll take it Off to Hawaii tomorrow,LRT
Waiting for the am Mauna Kea weather forecast wherein my fate will be predicted Will we do the science this year tick tick tick,ART
Did really just spend all Sunday morning writing software to analyze yesterday triathon results Um Maybe geek,ART
And Lilah She walked the run with broken toes still finished in the pack She should practice not breaking bones,LRT
number number And faster than half of the old guys Also clearly need to work on the run,ART
Beat THAT more than half of the old guys icanhaztophalffinish,LRT
Proud finisher Prouder dad,ART
It triathlon morning Lilah starts in min With working toes,ART
Check here and mock me endlessly if fail me group Also see if Lilah runs broken toes,LRT
OK all by this time tomorrow ll have finished my first triathlon My goal is to finish above the median for my age group,LRT
days out until our Subaru telescope time Weather still looking ok And our planning tool looks AWESOME,ART
For Flying to Titan Sure would be great Sorry about plutonium,HRT
love to go fly there It sure would be nice To know which kind of salts whales drink Under the ice,HRT
Europa has salt Which kind don know Chlorides or sulfates All mixed up with snow,HRT
Europa is red Where sulfur bombards it If you stuck your nose there It would smell just like shaaving cream NotSureWhereThatCameFrom,ART
ll be at Mauna Kea looking for tiny asteroids near Jupiter week from today Will the weather cooperate Maybe,ART
Why Europa Cause it cool yo,HRT
Nice to see so many signing up for my free online Science of the Solar System class Means gotta get recording,HRT
Perhaps we need to not allow her to engage in such dangerous activities Broken wrist Freeze tag Broken toes Trampoline BanTrampolines,LRT
Lilah is having tough triathlon training season First broken wrist Yesterdat broken toes Race next Saturday looking iffy for her,LRT
Online class starts March but you can go sign up RIGHT NOW For free And watch the video preview,HRT
ve been working on this project for long time now and can finally officially officially announce it The Science of the Solar System,ART
Finding dwarf planets Is the thrill of my life But nothing as good As you being my wife For NotAsBadDwarfPlanetValentines,ART
love you Like love Pluto By the way No longer consider you an adult BadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRT
Orcus and Vanth are tidally locked We could be the same If only you were more dissipative BadDwarfPlanetValentines OnlyMaybeTrue,HRT
My heart as full of love as Ceres is full of water Water in Ceres is still largely theoretical BadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRT
Hauema has red spot On its whiteish hue If you had red spot take you to the doctor too BadDwarfPlanetValentines,ART
Quauar is shiny With quite funny name If your name were more funny love you the same BadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRT
Eris is yellow With quite high albedo It got high mass Um unlike you BadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRT
Sedna is red Haumea is blue Well not really blue More like white BadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRT
Hey that island yesterday South Water Caye Belize Now you know,LRT
Spending week family on this mile long island in June Any guesses,LRT
Drones for science Students and teachers from Guam High School visited the Global Hawk today,ART
Sorry about Willie Nelson out of nowhere but just have Bloody Mary Morning running loudly through my head today No reason Promise,LRT
Just last night was professing that we need more Bob Dylan Willie Nelson but then realized there no topping this,LRT
no really it Tombaugh,LRT
This needs to be my new official bio pretty sure Scientists Get The Coolest Nicknames,ART
The book by the way is Tombaugh Out of the Darkness,ART
The only book in existence signed my me and Clyde Tombaugh,HRT
Not sure if it better to precede or follow really good speaker So today do both,ART
The official announcement includes the official trailer described to me as endearingly dorky by someone who may or may not be my wife,LRT
For those asking the online class starts March st on Free Look for offiicial announcement next week,ART
ve now recorded three weeks worth of my nine week class and it took weeks to do it At this rate will eventually finish Whew,ART
But think ll just walk down the hall and find John Grotzinger and make him do it instead MuchBetterIdea,ART
Today for my upcoming online class was going to record lecture about Curiosity on Mars and all of its cool discoveries,ART
The polar vortex has finally hit LA needed to wear long sleeve jersey for my bike ride today Wasn sure owned one Luckily did,ART
still think that if they had just played seconds longer at defense Alabama would be playing in the Super Bowl GenerallyUninformed,ART
the next person who says the word traceability followed by the word matrix in my vicinity is in for it,ART
Here is the state of the union at my house seconds ago Rommel,HRT
didn watch the state of the union but can tell via Twitter that the union remains snarky,HRT
Also did you know they discovered water there,ART
hate to say this while my friends might be listening but working on these lectures about Mars have made me think Mars is kinda cool,ART
So so so hard have awesome data to analyze fun class to work on and cool mission to develop What to do right now coffee,LRT
ve diagnosed the rattle in my Subaru engine It the acorns that the mice have stored for the winter,HRT
sad that got no video of the man playing guitar between Tesla coils last night But it looked like this,HRT
just saw man playing electric guitar in chainmail suite getting zapped with giant Tesla coils So there that,HRT
Helicopters flying around the house Bears or fires predict And the answer bear Also slow news night apparently GoAwayHelicopters,ART
That said the Ceres data look pretty good But variability always makes me nervous Unless it my own data Then always believe it,ART
Remember just because the new report of steam coming from Ceres is published in Nature doesn necessarily mean it is wrong,HRT
Today my job is to determine if that little peak in the data is real or not Because the answer matters,ART
Hey people in Cal kids Have you been to the Physics Forest yet Do go No Really,ART
ve trying to construct the perfect tweet explaining how cool it was to see the Endeavour up close and can Just this go see it,ART
Up close the Endeavour looks little worse for the wear but it still an amazing see sight,HRT
It official Lilah amp registered for our first triathlons Then helped make her spreadsheet for her training plan Cause geek,ART
Dear Colby Fire thanks for the nice sunset Now go away,ART
House consensus after tonight Harry Potter amp Order of Phoenix Least favorite of books most favorite of movies At least so far,ART
Recording lectures about early attempts to send spacecraft to Mars it is really really hard not to insert this clip,ART
So yeah my Dad was kind of rocket scientist Engineer really Worked on Apollo computers the lunar rover early space station,ART
FWIW This Medallion contains metal from spacecrafts Columbia and Eagle that took Astronauts Armstrong,ART
He have loved twitter And like to think he might somehow be reading it so hey Dad if you happen to follow me happy birthday,ART
On my desk at work have the clock and barometer from his boat his slide rule and his Apollo medallion,ART
My father would have been today It be fun to talk to him about what do now but can So tell stories to Lilah instead,ART
walk by this sign most days and never noticed current women relay record Yup,ART
Seriously degrees and wildfires,ART
Reading these astronomer experimental setup to measure the surface temp of Mars makes me feel stupid,ART
Anybody notice that the moon Jupiter looks like scale up version of Jupiter Callisto right this second Seriously Go get your binocs,ART
Spinrad my PhD advisor mostly studies distant galaxies but occasionally comets His wife says he just mistakes one fuzzball for the other,ART
How did not know that my own PhD advisor was the st to discover water on Mars Before was born SpinradRules,ART
First up Canals on Mars How could you not start class with canals on Mars,HRT
Today starting to record videos for my on line planetary science class Coming to computer near you in April on,HRT
Sometimes at sunset just sit and watch the nearly full moon rise outside my office window,HRT
But part of the Kuiper belt the cold classical part doesn fit into the story Which is weird See Even the tr dr version is tl,ART
Since they have the same size distribution the KB and JTs COULD be from the same source key hypothesis,ART
Here the tl dr version yes the Jupiter trojan asteroids and Kuiper belt objects have the same proportions of big vs med vs small objs,HRT
Thus ends all of my spectator sports related tweeting for the next months Oh wait No forgot Olympic curling is coming soon,ART
Wait is it actually legal for school not in Alabama to win the BCS Or are rare exceptions made for states bordering Alabama,HRT

Happy th birthday to Eris the most massive dwarf planet known IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE true NotAsImpressiveAsItSounds,HRT
One last view of the Endeavour done in flowers,HRT
Also the parade has hosted weddings before but atop this cake float yesterday was the st same sex one,ART
new icon the City of LA Rose Parade float leads with the Endeavour now hosted at the CA Science Center,HRT
Hmm Saying finally doesn make sense when my other tweets didn post Lets try again,LRT
Finally you might have noticed am back in pasadena They park the floats for up close viewing just down the street from my house,LRT
Happy th time the Earth has orbited the sun since an arbitrary time ago yay,HRT
My Keck run has ended Off for couple hours of sleep and then to join amp at the beach for couple of days Ahhhh Good night all,ART
for one don think you should call the Moon planet But ornery that way,ART
If you think spherical things should be classified as planets Ceres is good Also go outside amp look at the much larger planet Moon,HRT
Ceres And its raw spectrum Cute little spherical asteroid no,HRT
Still hrs of nightime left here in Hawaii Last target of the night Ceres am letting the telescope work while rest my eyes briefly,ART
Europa is just peeking out from the limb of Jupiter driving the telescope in that direction right this moment whales,ART
Ganymede And it raw spectrum We re looking for compositional differences between the equator amp poles,HRT
You might be glad to know that we are done with Uranus for the evening ahem,HRT
Uranus rotates fast one of the storms is nearly off the limb already,HRT
was training my new observing assistant earlier today,ART
The two bright dots on the faint disk are storms on Uranus with clouds high that sunlight reflects before being absorbed by methane,HRT
In the infrared Uranus is nearly invisible because of methane absorption but the faint rings still reflect sunlight,HRT
this is Saturday and at we must be observing Europa tonight Right right also Uranus and Ceres and Ganymede,ART
The sun Damnit Go away sun We are not through with Ceres,ART
Nice little arcsecond disk on Ceres no With the winds calmer the adaptive optics is rocking,ART
With hr left before sunrise the Mauna Kea winds have subsided enough to re open the Keck telescope Off to Ceres my friends maybe,ART
Reading on the current state of NASA It depressing to read even if you know it already,HRT
Keck still closed the Europa eclipse we came to see is lost But we took out an Dobs and watched in real life Cause that how we roll,HRT
Whoo hoo The winds are blowing so hard on Mauna Kea that the Keck telescope just blew sideways Um literally Closing for now,HRT
My promise to post boxing day pix of Europa is being stymied by the high winds on Mauna Kea could post pix of smeary things though,ART
OK ok maybe that not tradition But it will in fact be true tonight,LRT
Happy Boxing Day Traditionally on this day post images we take from that night Stay tuned for Uranus amp Europa amp Ceres,ART
Yup asteroid Mikebrown,ART
There is an asteroid named Mikebrown and today it makes its not very close closest approach of the year Merry Christmas from Mikebrown,HRT

when only few candles are left the shadows dance on the ceiling beautifully the last candle winner gets specially wrapped present,ART
everyone picks candle that they think will be the last one lit We watch drink champagne eat desert enjoy company,ART
get everyone and we sing Silent Night as we walk to the glowing tree we continue to sing carols until we run out of verses songs,ART
Our solstice traditions everyone but me retires to Lilahs room lights out and sings carols Meanwhile light candles,ART
Also do the vinez and blame and,ART
pre tree candle test can light needles even if we try,ART
ordered decade worth of tree candles from Denmark years ago It will soon be time to order yrs more,ART
Tree candles waiting for the solstice tonight,ART
Candles candle holders for the tree,LRT
In the woods Looking for our tree,LRT
The woods are lovely dark and deep and all but also far away So in practice we go to tree farm in Orange County,ART
Solstice My favorite day of the year my family biggest celebration First heading to the woods to find tree for tonight candles,HRT
spoiler alert No Is Pluto Planet New lesson featuring video with Mike Brown,ART
And don think Cosmicomics is comic book It is postmodern literature Geeky spacey Legion of Honor winning postmodern literature,LRT
Seriously ve even loaded it it up on amazon for you You can get it pre Xmas for your fellow geeky space friends,ART
mentioned Italo Calvino Cosmicomics to geeky space friend today and SHE HAD NEVER READ IT My dear geeky space friends Go read Now,ART
Needless to say REALLY DO NOT want white Christmas for Mauna Kea Like really,ART
If want to feel sad about my Europa plans for next week just look at THIS weeks weather,ART
My answer was uhhhhhh MT Where did Saturn Rings come from ask amp,LRT
Just got an email blast to Almacycle pis which must mean my ALMA Cycle proposal has quickly been accepted and am now PI RIGHT no,LRT
In week as you re dreaming of sugar plums ll be starting setup at Keck to observe Europa Which think of as my icy sugar plum,ART
Ice cream therapy the signatures of her friends have made for happier Lilah,ART
Dear Science Sometimes the amount of stupid just realized that did cannot be expressed on family friendly feed,HRT
My take friends don let friends break bones,ART
Words of wisdom from Lilah Breaking bone hurts worse than anything else ve done going to tell my friends to not do it,ART
For Lilah green is the new black,ART
The full moon is setting so far north that it reaches my bedroom window and startles me in the morning The solstice is near,ART
Hey everyone thanks for your well wishes for Lilah ll show her when she wakes up and it ll give her little smile,LRT
Horrible parent moment Lilah ow cry cry cry Me sure it just stings Me notices arm is crooked um yeah that probably hurts,LRT
The broken arm is going to seriously impact Lilah triathlon training,LRT
Lilah broke her arm which also breaks my heart If she wakes up in pain tonight might not be able to stand it BanFreezeTag,ART
OH The micron spectrum of Himalia is pretty It resembles an asteroid has studied won say which just to irritate him,ART
Still my favorite moon landing video of all time,HRT
Moon landing ok kinda love moon landings sorry That amazing Chang descent video,HRT
Having moon landing today makes me feel lot like kid again,HRT
pretty sure that Claire Danes should mostly always wear wings RomeoPlusJuliet,ART
Things forgot Mercutio is fabulous No Like REALLY,ART
Movie night for me and Lilah Romeo Juliet LdC and Claire Danes One of my faves Love the balcony pool scene And the aquarium geeks,LRT
Today best answer to what is on the surface of Himalia is maybe some kind of icy stuff maybe But ask me next week,ART
Bingo largest irregular satellite of Jupiter Now for the bonus question what is on its surface,ART
Today science trying to figure out what is on the surface of Himalia Quick without resorting to Google What is Himalia,ART
Thus at my group meeting today the topic of conversation was how could we detect these plumes without having to resort to HST space Hmmm,ART
My take on plumes on Europa awesome observations intriguing conclusions would love to see it more than once before believing,HRT
to go After couple of months of processing it is exciting to find the end within reach,LRT
Only potential orbits to check before we have searched for every possible bright KBO in the sky My computer keeping me warm,HRT
ZOMG After finding silly error in someone paper this morning found sillier error in one of my own papers ReverseShadenfreude,ART
ZOMG figured out my big question from last night Yes in fact the old Europa data that doesn match my new data is actually Io,ART
When faced with baffling data there is really only one clear choice Go home AndHaveAMartini,HRT
Interestingly it is shockingly hard to work out where telescope was pointed after the fact may never know the answer to this one,ART
Could it happen Mistake Io for Europa The scope was being run in service mode meaning non Jupiter observers were working think yes,ART
OK that hard to imagine But not any harder than reconciling my data with the earlier data,ART
My new data on Europa look so different from someone else previous data that am wondering if they accidentally looked at Io instead,ART
There frost on the field at Lilah school The kids are running around all excited thinking it is snow california,ART
liked Frozen but think it would ve been better if they had gotten permission from Pink and used The Truth About Love as the soundtrack,ART
Don cry for me analemma The truth is love later sunsets,ART
Taking Lilah amp her best friend to see Frozen today It about Europa right RIGHT,ART
OK still haven gotten to Europa science But did begin triathlon training today So that something Now with sore legs Europa,ART
The right hashtag for that last tweet feels like IMayNeverDoAScienceAgain,LRT
My first day of all science all the time resulted in writing final exam for my class filling out paperwork for travel Twitter,ART
By the deadline this morning am PST proposals were submitted to use the ALMA telescope next year Obv mine was the best,ART
Today ALMA proposal submitted last lecture of the term given Time for uninterrupted science for days Like days Europa think no,LRT
whose idea was it to put off writing this proposal until hours before it is due what am one of my students sheesh,ART
think that because of the Coriolis force PleaseDontListenToAnythingIsayTonight,ART
Also when it gets below in LA people say IT FREEZING outside so it is likely that water freezes at much higher temp around here,HRT
It so cold that going to try crazy experiment put bowl of water outside see if it freezes overnight ve heard wild rumors,ART
Just starting to get trickle of apps for grad school in planetary science Because people are always optimistic Or crazy Or dumb,ART
ve ton of work to do but can tear myself away from this NASA virtual town hall Like watching the last bit of shipwreck go under,HRT
Wow NASA is currently have Town Hall meeting and essentially telling planetary scientists to look for new jobs Wow,HRT
has new Assn VP of Campus amp Community Relations starting today hear she is fabulous Also unrelated am married to her,ART
was explaining to Lilah about my ALMA data and this week proposals This kinda says it all,ART
Word MT Can we go to Europa please Its choppy ocean looks friendly to life astrobiology icyworlds,ART
Also if can remember where the UCLA USC game is Rose Bowl Coliseum just step into my yard and seek the blimp It becomes clear,LRT

Oh My God,ART
In case you did not know was born in Alabama Thus by state statute am currently watching the Alabama Auburn football game RollTide,ART
Seriously good If you re curious about who is planet and who is not and why you should go read this now,HRT
Just heard that our observations that were killed by the shutdown might happen in Feb Go Europa am one happy astronomer,ART
Headed home We got more photons from this Keck run than ever OK so we were in the thermal IR and they were mostly sky but still,LRT
Good night people Do good things while dream of photons,ART
see the opposite hemisphere Comparing the two will tell us about surface contaminants coming from Io volcanoes,ART
Final target for the long Keck run Europa We got it nights ago now it has swung around to the other side of Jupiter and we can,ART
Before we fly back home we re taking second look at the Trojan asteroid Mentor Two nights ago it looked uh interesting Tonight,LRT
Now at Keck the Trojan asteroid Troilus Troilus was killed by Achilles so we re not going to observe Achilles tonight out of respect,ART
Our last fabulous night at the fabulous is underway More Trojan asteroids More spectroscopy More Europa More goodness,ART
Afternoon planning meeting for our last night at the Keck telescope,ART
took tiny nap in the mid of the night while here at and now the sun is coming up Wonder what observed,ART
In honor of ManicureMonday here is operating the NIRSPEC spectrograph on the Keck telescope,ART
Just turned the Keck telescope to Ennomos discovered by Carolyn Shoemaker from Palomar back in Tonight spectroscopy Ahhhhh,LRT
Back again Me and the gorgeous Mauna Kea weather Sun has set science is coming,ART
The sun is about to rise on another spectacular Mauna Kea night and while you can sleep when you re dead think will start now,ART
The trailing cloud of Jupiter Trojan asteroids has now set from Mauna Kea but now Jupiter is up Which means Europa And maybe some fish,ART
Midnight in Hawaii Time for new Trojan asteroid Mentor Who to Odysseus son was like um mentor,ART
ok made up that part about taste,ART
We re now taking look at Patroclus nd Trojan asteroid discovered possessor of satellite and low density Would float Bad tasting,ART
Starting off the night on the Trojan asteroid Alcathous again because well it is laggard and is the only Trojan up at sunset,ART
The sun is setting on Mauna Kea for another night at here with and just getting focused,ART
Up early to look at last night data and prep for tonight My favorite Hawaiian beach is only miles down the hill But no Because data,ART
The CFHT CloudCam search for ISON was fun but in the meantime we re still looking at Himalia with Keck Night nearly done Back tomorrow,LRT
think dawn is going to win You ll have to content yourself with yesterday ISON ride Plus cool weather,ART
think see ISON just at the edge of the rapidly brightening horizon It ll be race to see who wins,ART
Here where we re looking for the comet right now Still need Mercury to rise little more,ART
Mercury just appeared at the horizon ISON is not too far behind,ART
also do click on the hr loop to watch rising stars boiling clouds and the occasional meteor,LRT
Wanna see comet ISON Keep an eye on this live camera from the summit of Mauna Kea over the next minutes,HRT
Last stop tonight Jupiter distant satellite Himalia Why told me to,LRT
Now tracking Trojan asteroid Aneas Son of Anchises The son is not being cooperative tracking wise Wiley Trojans,ART
just realized you can see ISON rise pre dawn in this time lapse movie from last night on Mauna Kea Maybe tonight,ART
In astronomy spectroscopy is where the real science lives But the hot off the telescope data aren so pretty,HRT
Next up Anchises Trojan asteroid discovered in in Heidelberg Among the top ten in size of Trojans Nice bright target for Keck,ART
Charlie Kowal was looking for planet at the time just looking for methanol,LRT
First target this evening Alcathous Discovered years ago tonight by Charlie Kowal at Palomar First time looked at with Keck think,ART
Weather here on Mauna Kea looks glorious The Keck telescope and instrument are working perfectly hrs to sunset Let go get photons,ART
Fred Kavli had his fingerprints on lot of science Also he was nice to my family,ART
On the plane headed to Hawaii or as call it full hours of uninterrupted coding livingthelife,LRT
The stress of long run at the Keck telescope begins with cab that is hr late for my trip to LAX through rush hour rain,LRT
Just when flying to Hawaii to spend couple of nights at the telescope get an email full of data from ALMA in Chile ItsRainingData,ART
As someone flying to Hawaii tomorrow to use the Keck telescope Fri Mon nights this forecast makes me very happy,ART
Ever wonder how to ACTUALLY pronounce Quaoar Of course you did And now you can,ART
Watching the MAVEN pre launch sequence wondering who Roger is and why he never responds,ART

Need some Thursday night science in Pasadena speaking at benefit for tonight pm,ART
Needed demo for today class on coupled oscillations Found dental floss paper clips and binder clips in my drawer MacGyverPhysics,ART
Nice piece in Nature News on the oddities of UX and what it might mean for dwarf planet formation,HRT
Up early to drive down from great night of KBOs and comets at Palomar Pulled over for expired plates in Temecula BackToEarth,ART
comet ison looks cool but tooooo tiiiiirrrred to pooosssstttttttttttttttttttttttttttttzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,ART
In about hours we re going to observe comet ISON with the inch Palomar telesope Why Because we can that why,HRT
Beautiful night at Palomar We re collecting solar photons Well after they traveled to the outer solar system and bounced back,ART
Palomar Observatory night We have switched to the infrared camera hope we have switched to the clear sky too,ART
clouds aka this two year project has just turned into three year project,ART
found this note snuck into the suitcase packed to go to Palomar Observatory,HRT
Tomorrow night Palomar Observatory and the mighty Hale Telescope Here what we ll be doing,ART
love the fact that to save space in reference lists the journal Astrophysical Journal abbreviates the journal Nature as Natur,ART
also if you look hard you can see corner of the Ansel Adams print of the road to Lick Observatory behind my head lived that road,LRT
It was quite an honor Just saw you on BBCSkyatNight talking to very cool,LRT
My lecture notes for class today fit on one small sticky note And only made it of the way through,ART
wah wah waaaaah Should that be how do you makemake dwarf planets,ART
House rules paper on astro ph requires blog post Thus How do you make dwarf planets anyway,ART
So this is just one tiny point in sea of turbulent data but my health insurance premium is dropping in First drop ever Hmmm,HRT
list possible dwarf planets probable The top includes MS about which we know nearly nothing Someone get on it,HRT
Dwarf planet fans have finally updated my dwarf planet page to include the latest size albedo measurements Look,HRT
love it when an algorithm comes together st try yrs to process nd yrs rd days That ll do ilovemyhashtable,ART
have cool paper that need to put on astro ph but kind of unmotivated because don think ll get any cupcakes,LRT
On Thursday nights think of last week trash and how it would smell to bear and if should wait and put the cans out in the morning,LRT
It possible that our trick or treat route through the neighborhood was dictated by which neighbor was likely to have topper for the wine,ART

Also Southern California whatever you do do not slow down on the freeways just because of rain Because then you know the rain wins,HRT
The mysterious sky falling liquid appears to be water Checked around the office the elders remember this phenomenon from the distant past,HRT
Fellow Californians liquid is currently FALLING FROM THE SKY No joke Can tell its precise composition Analyzing Will report back,HRT

It only mad mad mad world after all those born after keep calm and carry on,LRT
For those asking the MOOC starts on The Solar System for Scientists Senior undergrad level All welcome,HRT
ve taught this tiny class for decade Adding the online part has quintupled my work load This has me terrified for the spring,ART
As warm up for my MOOC massive online open course on the solar system this spring am currently teaching TOCC tiny online closed,ART
It sad day here in southern California We had to eat dinner inside for the first time in months,ART
Tonight was the celebration for th anniversary of the Feynman teaching prize And these were the cookies,HRT
Clearly we should give it name which reflects that honor Hmmmm Seawise Giant,ART
had not thought to check before but it turns out KBO UX is the largest known solid body in the solar system that would float,HRT
Too late for me amp Europa Stupid shutdown We re back We now return you to your space related posts,HRT
It great to see everything coming back online after the shutdown but the amount of pissed off still have is not going away anytime soon,HRT
And in case you re wondering at years old Lilah understood much though not all Mostly she found Romeo drama queen Cause he is,ART
If she had said Dire Straits might not have felt the need to call her on it,ART
Reading Romeo amp Juliet to Lilah an amazing experience started when she told me how awesome Taylor Swift was for inventing the story,ART
Lilah and just finally finished Romeo and Juliet The ending is not how Taylor Swift promised,HRT
Hey since we should have guvment by tomorrow does that mean we can fly and observe Europa with SOFIA hint no too late sucka,HRT
still sad about missing Europa data on Thursday night because of the shutdown but this breaks my heart,HRT
Or should say we WOULD detect these things SOFIA remains grounded as testement to stupidity Europa keeps her secrets shutdown,ART
heading back to the SOFIA flying telescope this week for the second part of our program We should detect salts minerals ices,ART
To really understand Europa we need to get good look at the magnetospherically bombarded side and the non bombarded side So,ART
Good bye Denver and thanks for dps,LRT
The winner of my guess the density of the KBO UX prize cc ux DPS,LRT
Hey dps peeps don miss my talk in the afternoon KBO session as audience participation via Twitter will be required,ART
But tonight staying up all night dreaming of Europa photons that might have been And thinking our landing in Palmdale in more hours,ART
Except of course SOFIA is sitting in hanger in Palmdale and can fly due to the shutdown Tonight there will be no science,HRT
We are about to see things about Europa that we ve never seen before as no one has ever had this view before Can wait to share,ART
We ve been flying all night So now with less fuel we have risen to ft We re above much of the atmosphere water,ART
The telescope on SOFIA points out the left side of the plane and can swivel much to see Europa we have to fly precise direction,ART
The SOFIA flying telescope departed this evening and headed toward Canada but now we ve turned south to catch the just rising Europa,ART
Um no SOFIA is shut down Europa is still there but we on the ground will learn nothing except for the fruits of stupidity,HRT
SOFIA just took off We re flying across the US tonight looking up at Europa learning its secrets It beautiful up here Cold clear no,HRT
Oh yes Nobel Prize in Literature committee Yes indeed,ART
Fun conference games met twitter friend for the first time Still looking for though She might just be fake account,ART
Heading to Palmdale to get training for tomorrow flight of NASA SOFIA telescope Prime target Europa untrue shutdown canceled,ART
Noll talk unshutdown MT Looked for moons to extremely slowly rotating outer main belt and Trojan asteroids Found none,ART
Very excited to hear Keith Noll talk on Trojan asteroid moons Except forgot he is NASA employee and not allowed to be here dps,HRT
While in Denver ll also be live tweeting my SOFIA observations of Europa that aren happening due to the shutdown vaportweets,ART
on plane headed to Denver for DPS Two conferences in month Hope no one sees me and goes into shock Well sort of hope that,ART
find the mixed messaging on this packaging unsettling,ART
let try that again,LRT
find the mixed messaging on this package little unsettling,LRT
ll have memorial for all of the tiny photons that went from the sun to Europa and back to the earth only to die on the cloudtops,HRT
Oh Wait No don SOFIA is still grounded because the stupid is currently winning against Europa There will be no flights No data,HRT
Tomorrow head to Palmdale to get training in emergency procedures for the SOFIA flying telescope in prep for Thursday flight Fun fun,ART
wandered over to the Cosmos shoot and found that someone had just had birthday,ART
Ah ha Just figured out that the film crews crawling all over Caltech right now are filming for the new Cosmos,HRT
Pumpkin festival at sat amp Sun Rides games food music crafts And pumpkins Lottsa pumpkins,ART
Fire warnings for SoCal this weekend Tropical storm warnings in Gulf Blizzard warnings across Midwest Yup say its the apocalypse,ART
Just kdding SOFIA can fly during the shutdown So there will be no data We will learn nothing Nothing at all Next chance,HRT
week from now the SOFIA airplane telescope will be landing with ton of new data to help us understand the surface of Europa Can wait,HRT
Luckily for me my trees blew over last time MT potential Santa Ana wind gusts mph,ART

In minutes ll be doing an all about dwarf planets online chat with the AAAS Check it out,ART
They are letting me fly the plane,ART
can confirm lab experiments which show that solar irradiation leads to surface reddening,ART
So long Hawaii and thanks for the photons Sadly they were only solar,LRT
It makes me happy that took off minutes before the shutdown last night thus got to fly all night,ART
Dear Europa sorry but it looks like we might not get to learn your secrets with the next week nobudgetnophotons,HRT
So wonder if NASA IF telescope is still working tonight or if the photons headed its way spill aimlessly on closed dome instead,HRT
My Subaru Telescope observations have been canceled for the night What Is this the US Government or something,ART
Beautiful night last night here on Mauna Kea which made it all the more painful to sit with broken telescope and closed dome,ART
the subaru telescope is officially broken for the night and of course the sky is clear grumble grumble,ART
Hey Mauna Kea is looking high and dry at least for now In few minutes ll get an update on the telescope tech problems Fingers Xed,LRT
Also am happy because my flights on the SOFIA telescope are scheduled for this month And SOFIA flies above the clouds Which is awesome,ART
also should have mentioned am grumpy on the summit of Mauna Kea because CLOUDS Grr,ART
Oh hey forgot to mention as of this moment am on the summit of Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii because you know SCIENCE,HRT
Getting excited for Day of racing on the SF Bay Wait What have to go back to doing astronomy now Arrrrgggggghhhhhhhh Carry on,ART

Final race of the America cup starts in minutes Spectacular day on the SF bay Let hope for down to the wire race,LRT
because you know it free awesome and you ll learn ton of cool stuff Just sayin,ART
Hey so if you re really actually interested in thinking about machine learning in science you HAVE signed up for this class right,ART
That feeling of seeing that paper sitting on the dashboard inside the locked car Sigh,ART
That feeling of seeing your keys dangling from the ignition from outside of the locked car at least can read that paper while wait,ART
Unbelievable Americascup,LRT
Holy smokes that was about the fastest boat race ve ever seen Second race of the day in minutes Back to telescope proposal writing,LRT
Pretty sure never went knots downwind across the SF city front Spectacular to watch,LRT
No spoilers from me today but oh my big wind clear skies miss SF Bay sailing But watching this is the next best thing,LRT
Well so much for proposal writing for the next hour or so Americascup,LRT
