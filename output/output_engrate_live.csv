N165Mars,Sun Aug 19 12:45:53 +0000 2012,4429,131,15,4,0.338676902235,Maybe I'm just self-conscious because of my new robot friend. It almost looks like it's studying me! I must seem strange to an alien robot!

N165Mars,Sat Aug 18 13:38:05 +0000 2012,4429,131,5,2,0.112892300745,Maybe I should try again to introduce myself. I'm sure the poor creature is just disoriented from being in a new place!
