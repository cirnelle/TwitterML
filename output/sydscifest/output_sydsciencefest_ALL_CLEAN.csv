KS is discussing the different ways people can reject peer reviewed opensciecne Eg anti vaxxers qualms with polio vaccine etc ssf
Humans just tense the whole time self awareness fear etc So don try this at home plz ssf
KS This is why they are injured more on the shorter falls than longer ones Relaxing the body prevents some injury ssf
