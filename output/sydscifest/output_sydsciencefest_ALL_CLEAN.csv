Dr Maggie Aderin Pocock is done for her talk now But check out our other events coming up We are only getting started ssf natsciwk
Really looking forward to this event next week scicomm climatechange
Small boy The News said that galaxy is going to crash into us MP Yes yes that right there is unfortunately ssf
On Big Bang question MP The name Big Bang was an insult used to discredit the theory Similar to The God Particle ssf
Lots of auspol folk joining in on science experiments today at school for natsciwk
love blackholes They re are freaky but fascinating Think one in centre of every galaxy Maggie Aderin Pocock sydsciencefest
MP So you can detect them by watching the movements of nearby stars ssf
MP Detecting black holes are tricky because they don emit light but stars move around them ssf
Next What evidence do we have that black hole is at the centre of our galaxy ssf
First question from young girl what do you think aliens would look like MP ve prepared an image actually ssf
Dr Maggie Aderin Pocock is wrapping up her talk now with some questions ssf
MP What if aliens saw Earth with dinosaurs and just thought lets get out of here ssf
MP So many factors against us potentially meeting other life in space ssf
With tools such as spectrograph can look into the heart of stars Maggie Aderin Pocock sydsciencefest
MP The evolution of scientific ideas coupled with seeing how the cost of any kind of travel eventually drops supports space travel ssf
Seeing cells with research student Sam Rogers for NatSciWeek sydsciencefest
Reminder this is on tomorrow ssf
MP One of the best things about space travel now is that you are all from Earth You just have to work together Eg ssf
The cost of getting kgs into space costs somewhere between That the cost for only of water ssf
MP who here would make one way trip to Mars about two hands go up MP That INCREDIBLE ssf
The school kids in the audience seem very very keen on this idea ssf
Also the whole eviction thing But MP solves this problem by saying the winners get to go home Losers stay in space ssf
Biggest problem for space travel is cost So the Big Brother Space Travel idea solves that with reality TV funding Seriously ssf
MP has plan to get herself into space This plan is basically Big Brother meets interplanetary travel ssf
Maggie Aderin Pocock does great evil scientist laugh sydsciencefest
We are now learning about the ridiculous processes involved in having to go to the toilet in space spoiler locked doors and straps ssf
My husband and both became scientists and engineers because we like to ask why Maggie Aderin Pocock sydsciencefest
MP shows her students this photo and asks spot the scientist And people go for the white men ssf
The bottom photo is of MP and her husband both scientists ssf
MP it important for kids to see that you don need to be boy white or exceptionally serious to be scientist ssf
MP shows her students this photo and asks spot the scientist And people go for the white men ssf
MP When people think of scientists they usually think of someone white male and very very serious ssf
MP says Dyslexia impacted her education lot Asks are there any dyslexics in the house few arms MP Yaassss ssf
The overriding theme of MP talks are always that the future of space travel and astrophysics rests on the current generation in school
Great to see so many school groups and kids enthusiastic about space and astronomy at the today ssf
Starts by asking if space travel was as safe affordable as flight travel who would go into space whole room raises both arms ssf
Incredibly packed theatre for MP ssf

Why land the spacecraft on the comet if Philae is already there WH Why not Otherwise it ll just drift away sydsciencefest
We need to redefine our own plastic footprint take sydsciencefest
Here our homemade comet sydsciencefest
Science in nutshell
never had day at work where we tested something based on it working the spacecraft was basically designed to fail sydsciencefest
We will try to make black frozen ball of evaporating gas now which is pretty close to comet sydsciencefest
Holmes has finished his talk now Moving onto questions and MAKING COMET sydsciencefest
Putting things in context
believe this is the first image in that crevice looking into deep space sydsciencefest
We missed the landing site then bounced four times Then landed in crevice On it side sydsciencefest
We missed the landing site then bounced four times Then landed in crevice On it side sydsciencefest
Big lesson from the speed science meet up at Customs House Stick insects are great ice breakers http
The landing site for was unsuitable The comet is also so dark you can see it tricky sydsciencefest
But our plasma physicists have absolutely no idea what that is It freaked me out sydsciencefest
WH just played sound bite of the comet which kind of sounds like strange synthetic beat sydsciencefest
And there crack between these two parts so it could fall apart when going past the sun sydsciencefest
So the comet has neck body region which have different chemical compositions They appeared to have stuck together sydsciencefest
WH Also strange sand dunes with wind like features even though we are in deep space sydsciencefest
Fantastic reports from Could new malaria medicine come from high school
WH Cool things we found on the comet include cylindrical holes that we figured out were gas vents sydsciencefest
That INCREDIBLE can even find my shoes and they found spacecraft in the middle of space using math sydsciencefest
This meant that when it was time to switch it back on they had to CALCULATE where it would be in space sydsciencefest
WH So it had to be switched off Just the minimum amount of energy required to keep it going but no contact sydsciencefest
WH There was point where the craft got so far away from the sun that it couldn get enough energy sydsciencefest
Before the launch eight different people had to give the official Okay after checking the same parameters each sydsciencefest
Some of the widely varying temperature changes the Rosetta had to be tested for sydsciencefest
The cost of the WHOLE Rosetta mission cost the same as three weeks of the Australian military budget sydsciencefest
The cost of the WHOLE Rosetta mission cost the same as three weeks of the Australian military budget sydsciencefest

sadly no But was talking STEM creativity also for it was great ht
Great ideas in the mix at the STEM and creativity panel at
How was the show still at loss who
will tell you why astronomy sucks Astronomy is gateway drug sydsciencefest
Tonight at the we have Opened by and hosted by
Mind BLOWN by the one and only at the hordern tonight Just wow SydScienceFest AstrWoahPhysics
with his rhyming debate for population control sydsciencefest
really amazed about the huge amount of people in the queue for tonight show in Sydney
The Hordern is packed for tysonau
ABSOLUTELY AWESOME tonight in Sydney great job as host NatSciWeek
speaking for sydsciencefest tonight at
Tonight at the we have Opened by and hosted by
Explode it with Science at tomorrow lots happening plus we re blowing stuff up because we can natsciwk syds
arguing in that previous round sydsciencefest
Yep the random topics were good fun
Shout out to all those debaters and for putting it on sydsciencefest
And the winning debater for our event is Such win for chemistry sydsciencefest
Explode it with Science at tomorrow lots happening plus we re blowing stuff up because we can natsciwk sydsciencefest STEM
PR The chances of the cat being alive is the same probability of you and me picking the same atom in the universe sydsciencefest
PR scientists need reproducibility if they want to publish And we can with this theory sydsciencefest
Random debate is Schrodingers Cat dead or alive is arguing DEAD sydsciencefest
AW Chemists want to design drugs to fight off parasites Humans have lot of evolving to do before we are the best sydsciencefest
We need chemistry to pick up where evolution left off sydsciencefest
AW We haven managed to evolve to fight off parasites And you know who we need to help us Chemists sydsciencefest
Well despite all this evolving parasites can still take over your body in an instant sydsciencefest
DC We ve made cooking cultures all things And we have screwed up the planet so much we have shifted the earth rotation sydsciencefest
DC We have thrown evolution on its head by living longer having babies later sydsciencefest
DC But dont try walking around naked saying that scientist said the Naked Ape idea is myth sydsciencefest
DC humans are not as naked as we think we are Our bodies have the same coverage as apes its just fair and thin sydsciencefest
Grand Final is DC humans and for chemistry sydsciencefest
argument against population control is basically lets just go see what other planets we can screw up sydsciencefest
with his rhyming debate for population control sydsciencefest
arguing in that previous round sydsciencefest
Random topic round global population control is positive who is arguing in rhyming prose sydsciencefest
JB Which means Med needs to focus less on humans being male default in medical research and start studying differences sydsciencefest
JB We study all these animals for telomeres and cancer except women live longer and don get some diseases sydsciencefest
JB The issue have with humans is that the default is man Women have been around for while too though sydsciencefest
DC Eg Sex in other animals is purely evolutionary act But humans love it sydsciencefest
DC up now against DC arguing again for humans Humans he argues are basically just weird sydsciencefest
AW Physicists only get measurements of things that chemists have already done sydsciencefest
AW Chemists are the doers they get things done they can multitask sydsciencefest
for chemistry think we lesrnt from PR is that you never know where physicists are Never date one sydsciencefest
PR Quantum entanglement and what is it useful for Quantum computers Future use of this is massive sydsciencefest
PR speaking on how cool superpositions are again and using them for super fast communication sydsciencefest
Now for physics and for chem sydsciencefest
LS Astrology has had thousands of years if research Astronomy not so much sydsciencefest
will tell you why astronomy sucks Astronomy is gateway drug sydsciencefest
AM Astronomy helps predict the future and also understand the past It brings lot of kids into science sydsciencefest
AM is astronomy and is for astrology remembering she is actually an astronomer awkward sydsciencefest
Semi finals are up soon First one is and Random topic is astronomy vs astrology sydsciencefest
Jb speaking about how some differences in gender can affect which medicine to use sydsciencefest
JB also get to work with brain cells ve got some in petri dish right now actually sydsciencefest
JB work on gender differences have to have that talk with lots of grown men all the time sydsciencefest
JB Med research is weird and cool and also inherently good yes sydsciencefest
is up now for Medicine sydsciencefest
MB interview Med students and lot of them are motivated by misplaced goals sydsciencefest
MB My biggest complaint with Med is that it too good Inherently good sydsciencefest
MB Bacteria has technologically advanced parts and functions and it makes itself sydsciencefest
is arguing for bacteria sydsciencefest
vs up now sydsciencefest
You could store secret codes or information and store them in your DNA that pretty cool sydsciencefest
AW The future of DNA is going to be in data storage because of it ability to hold so much data sydsciencefest
AW If you pull DNA out of the cell it has enough to go to the moon and back sydsciencefest
is up now arguing for DNA sydsciencefest
DC DNA can laugh cry make iPhones blush fart do anything really sydsciencefest
DC We make things Tools cars rockets iPhones We are the only animal to have water pouring out of our eyes when sad sydsciencefest
DC Ashley field DNA is just small You can even see them sydsciencefest
DC We are intelligent We are conscious Self aware That amazing in itself sydsciencefest
DC Humans are the best research topic We are everywhere and involved in so many different areas sydsciencefest
Darren Curnoe up against sydsciencefest
AM has finished his debate by reinforcing that Nanotech has lots of ideas with Chem running out sydsciencefest
AM Chem mixes things together but nanotech does weird things Self cleaning surfaces better velcro sydsciencefest
now Going for the route of Chemistry being PC and Nanotech being Mac Nanotech is cool according to AM sydsciencefest
AW So if nanotech takes over the world the chemists will help us sydsciencefest
AW Obvs meth is very destructive drug but the show also covered an awesome aspect of Chem cancer treatment sydsciencefest
AW Chemistry has also given us the best TV show ever made Breaking Bad faircall sydsciencefest
OOoo AW is also taking the route of engulfing the opponent field into their own Nanotech is part of Chemistry sydsciencefest
is speaking for Chemistry against Adam nanotechnology sydsciencefest
NEXT DEBATE vs sydsciencefest
QP is far more important than astronomy because her field wouldn exist without quantum physics sydsciencefest
PR When Lisa looks at stars and galaxies the research SHE is actually using is quantum physics sydsciencefest
PR One cool thing about QP is super positions things can be in two places at the same time sydsciencefest
up now with quantum physics From the BIG to the tiny now sydsciencefest
ll end with the definition of the Universe everything in the world rest my case sydsciencefest
You might think astronmers are useless we just look at the sky But astronomers invented Wifi sydsciencefest
LS My second point is alcohol Alcohol is great in moderation ofc sydsciencefest
LS And supernova is an explosion Also the Big bang All important explosions Astronomy creates some good explosions sydsciencefest
LS up first want to convince you my research rules And as we know the most important part of science is EXPLOSIONS sydsciencefest
vs up first sydsciencefest
The debate is about to start which will actually be legitimate debate with voting and rounds and the lot sydsciencefest
Waiting for the debate to start sydsciencefest
Waiting for the debate to start sydsciencefest
