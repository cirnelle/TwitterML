Eg anti-vaxxers  qualms with polio vaccine etc #ssf15Humans just tense the whole time (self awareness  fear  etc). So don't try this at home plz #ssf15KS: This is why they are injured more on the shorter falls than longer ones. Relaxing the body prevents (some) injury #ssf15KS: Cats tend to tense up in the first few seconds of falling but then relax after a while of free falling #ssf15"Onto a (kind of) nicer topic  'why do cats jump out windows and generally are fine?"". Lots of pretty great cat pics on screen rn #ssf15"There was once an elephant who was charged for murder and no one knew how to do the execution  so... #ssf15"Westinghouse refused to contribute to the electric chair  whereas Edison championed for his (KS: ""Edison was a pig of a man"") #ssf15"Moving onto the Edison vs. Westinghouse debate  one of the key motivations of electricity was better execution methods... #ssf15"KS: ""Never fly a kite in a thunder storm.

You just have to work together. Eg. @ISS_Research #ssf15The cost of getting 1.5 kgs into space costs somewhere between $70-100k. That's the cost for only 1.5L of water! #ssf15"MP: who here would make a one-way trip to Mars?  *about two hands go up""  MP: That's INCREDIBLE #ssf15"The school kids in the audience seem very  very keen on this idea. #ssf15Also  the whole eviction thing... But MP solves this problem by saying the winners get to go home. Losers stay in space. #ssf15Biggest problem for space travel is cost. So  the Big Brother Space Travel idea solves that with reality TV funding.  Seriously.  #ssf15MP has a plan to get herself into space. This plan is basically...

Wrapping up with some questions... #ssf15Video onscreen of using a robot with a camera on it to take photos of Tigers. #ssf15SW: The alarm call for a tiger is a spotted deer squeak. You hear that  there's a tiger nearby. #ssf15SW: ecotourism  next gen education  working with local communities - all things that help stop this hunting #ssf15SW: People use rhino horn for supposed medicinal value. It's made of keratin. You're better off chewing your nails #ssf15SW: The protection of rhinos is the only one in India that has a shoot to kill policy #ssf15Moving onto rhinos now #ssf15"""Finally  I moved onto the tiger. They are very endangered  hard to find and highly revered "" #ssf15"This is it #ssf15 http://t.co/eHQmYrbI06SW: After 15 months  I finally got a shot of one in front of the Hollywood sign #ssf15SW: I got a picture of a cougar. A bobcat. A deer. A raccoon. A guy walking his dog. Some hikers. But no mountain lion. #ssf15SW: I really wanted to get a photo of a mountain lion on front of the Hollywood sign. Just because. #ssf15SW: Unfortunately  people hunt mountain lions because they aren't  endangered. #ssf15SW: My first photo was of a half a field mice. But a year later  we got some of cougars #ssf15SW: Even though these cats were tagged to study them in relation to wolf packs  I still had a lot of trouble photographing them #ssf15SW: In all this time  I had never worked in the US  so I started looking at cougars #ssf15SW: I was told you would never get a photo of a cat during the day. Well  cats do whatever you don't want them to do. So I got one. #ssf15"""Zen and the Art of Photo Capture"" #ssf15"SW: You know how you go through your phone photos and there are heaps of your face by accident? That's all we had during that trip #ssf15"""Then we had to load that on horseback and walk up the mountains"" #ssf15""""I brought 33 bags with me on the trip to photograph the snow leopard""   For those wondering it looked like maybe 15 airport trolleys #ssf15"SW then decided to pick the next  most difficult big cat to find - SNOW LEOPARDS. #ssf15"""First time I did it  a jaguar called back  I got scared and drove away"" #ssf15"Apparently you can stick your head in a bucket and make a weird noise to call a jaguar #ssf15SW: Cats are curious animals  they want to know who is in their territory #ssf15Naturally  Steve Winter took it on #ssf15Apparently in all the decades @NatGeo was in print  they had never done anything on the 3rd biggest cat in the world. It was too hard #ssf15"One of his mates told him the next day ""oh don't worry  that was just a black jaguar"".   ""And that's how Big Cats chose me..."" #ssf15"Then one night  he heard the floorboards creaking  the stairs creaking and sniffing at his head. #ssf15When SW was just getting started with being the jungle  he couldn't figure out why for the first few nights he felt uneasy... #ssf15SW: Im going to take you on a trip with these four cats; Jaguars  Snow Leopards  Cougars and Tigers #ssf15"*photo of a rhino* ""This wasn't supposed to be a rhino  we wanted a leopard  but oh well"" #ssf15"SW: I love visiting S.Africa  its so beautiful and easy to work with. You're guaranteed to find the Big 5 #ssf15Spotted a drone! #ssf15.@swfoto is starting off his talk with some incredible footage of BIG CATS.
