The United States cannot continue to make such bad  one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more! See Lyin' Ted  even the @DailyBeast (no fan of mine) says this story came from Rubio  not Trump! https://t.co/Okc8XajVnz Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be  I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS! Another radical Islamic attack  this time in Pakistan  targeting Christian women &amp; children. At least 67 dead 400 injured. I alone can solve Happy Easter to all  have a great day! My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now  finally  receiving plaudits! Wow  sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others Remember  I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters  I am not bought like others! Don't believe the @FoxNews Polls  they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election. Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S.  jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out! Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story! The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women  when they know that it is just the opposite! The media is so after me on women  Wow  this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump! "@pattiandsammi: @gullakhta99 @realDonaldTrump @Tytan01 @CNN WOMEN LOVE TRUMP.

How am I still number one - by a lot? I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania  he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence  Lyin' Ted! Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/PHgrT1Nl27 Endorsements for Lyin' Ted Cruz- https://t.co/c3QEbexOwT Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria.

I alone can fix this problem! "@Doctor_S_Freud:  @TheView They're all brain-dead puppets with skeletons in their closet.

"@TimVincent56:  @LindseyGrahamSC Talkers think about the future  Doers are already building it" #VoteTrump2016 https://t.co/OoB38jypsD" It is amazing how often I am right  only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration  take the oil  build the wall  Muslims  NATO! Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right! These politicians like Cruz and Graham  who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years  do nothing to make things better! .@LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS  do nothing! It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run! "@missi51: .@realDonaldTrump thank God is not a politician  but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us  the people." We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate  and the time is now! N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!

While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates  it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race! I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150 000 000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first! I will be the best by far in fighting terror. I’m the only one that was right from the beginning  &amp; now Lyin’ Ted &amp; others are copying me. Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. She’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are! Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates  Lyin’ Ted Cruz. Honestly  I can’t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion! Lyin’ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me  and lines from Michael Douglas— just another dishonest politician. Thank you  Arizona! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain https://t.co/MMPR0Omwog https://t.co/Dgqky0JiHO Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted! Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November  paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices! Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you  I will never forget! Thank you  Arizona! #Trump2016 #WesternTuesday #TrumpTrain https://t.co/VMCzxrryG8 Incompetent Hillary  despite the horrible attack in Brussels today  wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way! Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful  Lyin' Ted  or I will spill the beans on your wife! Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately &amp; get home to Washington- where a #POTUS  under a serious emergency belongs!

The good news is  nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore  especially me! .@WSJ Editorial says "Clinton primary vote total is 8 646 551.Trump's is 7 533 692"-a knock. But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16.Apologize The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem! Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that  @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough! Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating Crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win! Stuart Stevens  the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss  is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad! I will be interviewed on The O'Reilly Factor this evening at 8 pm on the Fox News Channel. @oreillyfactor Thank you  Missouri! #Trump2016 https://t.co/iOzGtcBbia Wow  just won Missouri! I am making a big speech the night of the @FoxNews debate  but I wish everyone well. Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins! Thank you to the Governor of Florida  Rick Scott  for your endorsement. I greatly appreciate your support! In the last 2 weeks  I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida &amp; I won in a massive landslide.The establishment should save their $$! Yesterday was amazing—5 victories.  Lyin’ Ted Cruz had zero. Things are going very well! Is this what we want for a President? https://t.co/2yYy6Nyta9 .@RepTomMarino  Great job on television this morning. Glad to have you on my side! "@FoxBusiness: .@RepTomMarino: I think @realDonaldTrump can beat HillaryClinton. And I'm looking forward to Trump being president. .@pastormarkburns You were great last night and we all very much appreciate it! Thank you! "@MaryEH428: @RealBenCarson I thank God you are on board with @realDonaldTrump to help him and us #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Ty!!" Thank you Marco  I agree! https://t.co/PTfFzFno9p I only wish my wonderful daughter Tiffany could have been with us at  Mar-a-Lago for our great election victory. She is a winner!

Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people  big &amp; over! "@DumpFoxNews: @FoxNews @megynkelly  If media wasn't so biased against Trump  he would've won all of the delegates. "@SCNAK45: @megynkelly is trying so hard to bash @realDonaldTrump it's ridiculous" Don't worry  everyone is wise to Crazy Megyn! "@jsconlon11:  @BertShad @Foxnews @megynkelly I tried to give them a shot tonight  but they have the whole anti Trump cheerleading team." "@BertShad: Was going to watch @Foxnews for the primary results but saw @megynkelly - looks like #CNN tonight" Word is that  despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads  I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon! A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false. I will bring our jobs back to the U.S.  and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again. In presidential voting so far  John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him  I will beat Hillary! Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico  now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now! Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate  until I put him down. #VoteTrump #SuperTuesday ✅Florida ✅Illinois ✅Missouri ✅North Carolina ✅Ohio  #TrumpTrain  https://t.co/zyRctsFmSq https://t.co/kxrn0ev4UF North Carolina lost 300 000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400 000 since 2000. Going to Mexico etc. NO MORE IF I WIN  WE WILL BRING BACK! Just in  big news- I have been declared the winner of the CNMI Rep Caucus with 72.8% of the vote! Thank you! #SuperTuesday #VoteTrump Good morning Ohio! Some additional information from my daughter  @IvankaTrump! #VoteTrump #SuperTuesday https://t.co/H7sBEnSpYq Don't reward Mitt Romney  who let us all down in the last presidential race  by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA  open borders etc.). Please remember  I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich  Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists! I will bring our jobs back to America  fix our military and take care of our vets  end Common Core and ObamaCare  protect 2nd A  build WALL Rubio is weak on illegal immigration  with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Kasich voted for NAFTA  a disaster for Ohio  and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness! "@wh: https://t.co/AZmCErLKCn WOW people are so misinformed on DonaldTrump character! Watch this video! Hillary and Bernie don't come close "@realwwshelton: @loudobbsnews I believe that @realDonaldTrump will be the big winner tomorrow."  Thank you! "@BrazielCarol: @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Who started this mess  the protesters of course . And media made it worse." Sadly  this kind of stuff even happened to Ronald Reagan.

Get out &amp; #VoteTrump tomorrow. #Trump2016 https://t.co/OReGiIS6TF Kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in Ohio. I will bring them back! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA  which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers! Leaving the great people of North Carolina. Amazing event. Heading to Tampa now! #VoteTrump Look forward to being in Tampa this afternoon. Wonderful crowds. Thank you  Florida!

They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people! Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- &amp; should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue. Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action! https://t.co/08xkEBD8Be Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party  Republican wins will be massive!  https://t.co/1rmyCGSlsV Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television  he only watches the @GolfChannel Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA  from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP  which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying! Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie  or my supporters will go to yours! "@alextrent4: It is repulsive that Trump was assaulted+politicians used that 2 further themselves+2 further victimize Trump! DISGUSTING!!" Wow  Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania  not enough signatures. Big problem! USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! https://t.co/tkzbHg7wyD?ssr=true Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words  education of your children from D.C. No way #EndCommonCore #Trump2016 Video: https://t.co/krYK2DiAlh https://t.co/RAH45igqJI Just finished my second speech. 20K in Dayton &amp; 25K in Cleveland- perfectly behaved crowd. Thanks- I love you  Ohio! https://t.co/IDmwG5FQsw It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians! The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact! We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio.  No way to run a country! Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco  his State Chairman  &amp; their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote. The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Thank you Dayton  Ohio! 20 000 supporters- largest in airport history! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/ry2p5qGcFt MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! On my way to Dayton  Ohio. Will be there soon! The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio! Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil  they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud! Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico! The organized group of people  many of them thugs  who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago  have totally energized America! I just got off the phone with the great people of Guam!

While I am leading  they are totally discredited after last S.C. poll The negative television commercials about me  paid for by the politicians bosses  are a total #Mediafraud. When you watch  remember! Mitt Romney had his chance and blew it. Lindsey Graham ran for president  got ZERO  and quit! Why are they now spokesmen against me? Sad! Remember  I am the only one who is self-funding my campaign. All of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests! Sun Sentinel says: Rubio lacks the experience  work ethic and gravitas needed to be president. HE HAS NOT EARNED YOUR VOTE!

Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment. Dishonest people! Leaving for North Carolina. Big crowd  will be fun! I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate  he is scamming Florida We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT  who could not stop Obama (twice)  ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of  $'s in false ads! Lindsey Graham is all over T.V.  much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty  angry  jealous  failures have ZERO credibility! Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run  brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. Now nasty! How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? I will be using Facebook &amp; Twitter. Watch! All of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS  the bandits that tell your pols what to do .@meetthepress and @chucktodd did a 1 hour hit job on me today – totally biased and mostly false. Dishonest media! Thank you to @jdickerson and @FaceTheNation for a very fair and professional interview this morning. No wonder you are #1 in the ratings!

The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want  to go to court. 98% approval rating by students. Easy win Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago? I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton. I am not a Mitt Romney  who doesn't know how to win. Hillary wants no part of "Trump" Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who  as a Senator  never even shows up to vote - worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke! I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party  while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement! Failed candidate Mitt Romney who ran one of the worst races in presidential history is working with the establishment to bury a big "R" win! "@malski1954: I changed parties to vote for you  no one else measures up to you  The GOPe needs a reality check. Our country is at stake" Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger! Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio &amp; Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS "@Johnsmi01433966: The establishment doesn't like you because they can't control you and get you to lie to us and keep ripping us off." Because of me  the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters  a record. If they are not careful  they will all leave. Sad! I would love to see the Republican party and everyone get together- and unify.

Little Marco Rubio  the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is just another Washington politician. https://t.co/NsLrHrqjdx As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow. https://t.co/OIXFKPUlz2 Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. He is another all talk  no action pol! Little Marco Rubio  the lightweight no show Senator from Florida  is set to be the "puppet" of the special interest Koch brothers. WATCH! Making a big speech in Alabama today. So many people we had to move to a football stadium! Come and join us! I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies (crossover). I will also get states that no other Republican can get. While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins  Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles.GROWING PARTY The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to "hit" Trump.I signed the pledge-careful While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil)  word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio  the lightweight from Florida "@ilduce2016: “It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.” – @realDonaldTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain" We need to fix our broken education system! #StopCommonCore  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  Video: https://t.co/xZ1eCJPo8T https://t.co/S8gQ6cibhC THANK YOU Arkansas!

He is not as smart as Cruz  and may be an even bigger liar I started my business with very little and built it into a great company  with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing! I only wish my wonderful father  Fred  gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication! Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people! I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz! Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit  no problem! I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year.

Wow  every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor! Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material! Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed! Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit! Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday.

He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar! Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina  it's over. He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide! Thank you Illinois! #Trump2016 https://t.co/Ol0u2Krkwc Join me in Oklahoma tomorrow night! #MakeYoutubeGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/sUTcDoip3C I'm going to do what @MittRomney was totally unable to do- WIN! Signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous? https://t.co/UdwqF4iZIZ Just for your info  tax returns have 0 to do w/ someone’s net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great! Mitt Romney  who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics  is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope! When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear  I will get most of his votes - no problem! Why would Texans vote for "liar" Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada  lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around  he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win! Mitt Romney who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool  is now playing tough guy The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters. That is how I got to 46%. When others drop out  I will pick up more.  Sad but true MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/IVSR0hmh5g In all of television- the only one who said anything bad about last nights landslide victory-- was dopey @KarlRove. He should be fired! I am self funding my campaign &amp; don't owe anybody anything! I only owe it to the American people! #Trump2016 Watch: https://t.co/fUzX92RYIm .@USATODAY Poll and @QuinnipiacPoll say that I beat both Hillary and Bernie  and I havn't even started on them yet!

Great. Just reported on @FoxNews that many people who supported @JebBush are now supporting me. I knew that would happen  pundits didn't! Wow  great Ohio poll. Shows me leading by 5 points  beating K! Unlike the other Republican candidates  I will be in Nevada all day and night - I won't be fleeing  in and out. I love &amp; invest in Nevada! I am growing the Republican Party tremendously - just look at the numbers  way up! Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past. THANK YOU LAS VEGAS  NEVADA! #NevadaCaucus #VoteTrumpNV https://t.co/cZlNRrFtW3 https://t.co/scdxT24Dye Thank you Michigan! #VoteTrumpMI Trump 35% Kasich 17% Cruz 12% Rubio 12% Carson 9%  Via: ARG Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false  more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy? Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support! Wow  Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks! It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve  and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done. Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate. I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry! I hear the Rickets family  who own the Chicago Cubs  are secretly spending $'s against me. They better be careful  they have a lot to hide! The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR  and Evangelicals do not like liars! I am in Las Vegas  at the best hotel (by far)  Trump International. I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada! A number of months ago  I was not expected to win South Carolina Ted Cruz was  and yet I won in a landslide - every group and category. WIN! THANK YOU Atlanta  Georgia! Leaving for Nevada now. Lets MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/wHfraU67yX https://t.co/WqvxMwJk2S The failing @WSJ Wall Street Journal should fire both its pollster and its Editorial Board.

"@mikeliberation: This is the best reaction shot I've ever seen lol #Trump2016" https://t.co/jqxI7QoxEY What a great night. Thank you South Carolina  a special place with truly amazing people! LOVE People (pundits) gave me no chance in South Carolina. Now it looks like a possible win. I would be happy with a one vote victory! (HOPE) South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now (today)  and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in. Don't allow it I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go! I am the only candidate (in many years) who is self-funding his campaign. Lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The just out USA Today National Poll  where I lead by big numbers  shows that in a head to head matchup  I beat both Hillary and Bernie. Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls  the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.

He wants to look cool  but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada! Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1%  he should take his dumb mouthpiece  @LindseyGrahamSC  and just go home. .@FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative! I will beat Hillary easily  but Lindsey Graham says I won't  and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on? Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I "would never be president" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history! Why does @megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me  almost always negative?  Without me her ratings would tank. Get a life Megyn!

Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates  Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy  now brother! Ted Cruz  along with Jeb Bush  pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice  but didn't! Wow  in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you! Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists &amp; special interests - the bosses! Loved the debate last night  and almost everyone said I won  but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors &amp; special ints Thank you for your support!

"@wino911:  #Trump2016 We know better than to trust the RNC https://t.co/EMcgtK25fE"   So cute! The RNC  which is probably not on my side  just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC. Just got back from Tampa. It was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd - fantastic people! Will be in South Carolina tomorrow. 11 000 inside venue tonight in Tampa! Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments! Another 5 000 outside. Will be back! I will end illegal immigration and protect our borders!

How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest? Lying Cruz put out a statement  “Trump &amp; Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage." Cruz is the worst liar  crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3? THANK YOU- Baton Rouge  Louisiana! WE will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #Trump2016 https://t.co/XV7EIe7A2l Just landed in Baton Rouge  Louisiana. Reports are out that lines are three quarters of a mile to get in. Wow! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me. We are watching! Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance! He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Remember  it was the Republican Party  with the help of Conservatives  that made so many promises to their base  BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT Jeb Bush spent more than $40 000 000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5  I spent $3 000 000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability! I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local! THANK YOU- Clemson  South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #SCPrimary https://t.co/FgACmaFxxc So funny  Jeb Bush called me a "highly gifted politician and a great entertainer" - I assume that is a compliment! Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today. Thank you to the people of  New Hampshire  I love you! Now  off to South Carolina. Thank you  New Hampshire! Departing with my amazing family now! #FITN #NHPrimary https://t.co/rbFfcq8gQq https://t.co/73aoZk8uMG We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border. We will build a WALL and have security. We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare! ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our "leader" - If I win it will be a very different story with very fast results New Hampshire vote today -  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great! Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign  he says he would end super PACs. Sad! America needs strong leadership. Politicians can talk but they don’t get things done. Video: https://t.co/YwZdQdzKcz https://t.co/lBXXyuZAcO Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bush-spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. A pathetic figure! Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate! So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Wow  Jeb Bush  whose campaign is a total disaster  had to bring in mommy to take a slap at me. Not nice! 10 000 people in South Carolina  unbelievable evening! Will be in New Hampshire tomorrow- love it. https://t.co/tF033Yjhu3 I very much look forward to tomorrow’s debate in New Hampshire—so many things to say  so much at stake.

Cruz just lied again- I am  and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace! The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud! This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud https://t.co/tRM7KUCrSU Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus  either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. And finally  Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie! The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also  Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters. Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa  he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!  #FITN #Trump2016  https://t.co/oUg1ErD0j7 https://t.co/9Hb7JO3wrZ Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long  rambling  overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment! "@stephbewitching @realDonaldTrump All you haters need to realize Trump got the second highest vote in history. And he's never held office!" I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign  the only one. I will keep doing  but not worth it! I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history! Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa  I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz &amp; Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice It all begins today - WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It is time to take back our country- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #CaucusForTrump Video: https://t.co/y9Fa8Ut6IP https://t.co/bJ6a0t9Pv2 By not doing the failed  poorly rated debate  I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6 000 000 for VETS. Wow  just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me  will repeal &amp; replace. He lies! Ted Cruz is totally unelectable  if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN! I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife  Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State! I want to thank evangelical Christians for the warm embrace I've received on the campaign trail. Video: https://t.co/u6oOcWGePe I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning. Finally  after all these years of watching stupidity  we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material! THANK YOU to all of the incredible volunteers  behind the scenes in Iowa! #CaucusForTrump https://t.co/osvIsBwAgX https://t.co/EY0wNYv9XD .@oreillyfactor  The people of Iowa love the fact that I stuck up for my rights  as I will do for the U.S. Also got $6 000 000 for our VETS! .@FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6 000 000 raised in one hour for our VETS. The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum  how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president? They say that if I participated in last night’s Fox debate  they would have had 12 million more &amp; would have broken the all time record. Thank you!

Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses. Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S.  or we won't have a country anymore! In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion  7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others! Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about &amp; demeaning? https://t.co/rYGX9vazku Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions  $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul  &amp; $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite Great new numbers.

No more being politically correct. Top searched candidate by state  as seen in the #GOPDebate media filing center. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/nwKPRmWFNr Sen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush. Jeb Bush  who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero  just got Graham endorsement. Graham quit at O. Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors? Our country was humiliated. United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win! Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures &amp; images. We are weak. I will NOT forget! THANK YOU  IOWA!

Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW! Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her  voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters! The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring  rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast! The #SOTU speech is really boring  slow  lethargic - very hard to watch! .@megynkelly recently said that she can’t be wooed by Trump. She is so average in every way  who the hell wants to woo her! Thank you to our law enforcement officers! #LESM #Trump2016 https://t.co/sfuuVrx33E In the just out @FoxNews Poll  I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! We could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in. The movement to Make America Great Again is unbelievable! https://t.co/NHPdGm57YJ Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART! Germany is going through massive attacks to its people  by the migrants allowed to enter the country. New Years Eve was a disaster. THINK! I am in New Hampshire. Just received great news from Reuters poll. Thank you for your support! https://t.co/yzp9dGfbce Woody Johnson  owner of the NYJets  is @JebBush’s finance chairman. If Woody would’ve been w/me  he would’ve been in the playoffs  at least! By the way  Hillary &amp; the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the  Al-Shabaab terror video. https://t.co/gRannsRXJr The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch. Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm! Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate. Remember  I am self-funding my campaign  the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.! When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates  beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$! I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women! Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL  but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant! The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is  by far  me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped! #HappyNewYearAmerica! https://t.co/EeQb8PDrUe HAPPY NEW YEAR &amp; THANK YOU! https://t.co/YO1Yi8QbZy https://t.co/uxUXWJ1Rbv I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO  FINALLY  MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN! New #ReutersPoll. Thank you America!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/oETsjV3aR4 So  I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million &amp; done. Run country my way! My campaign for president is $35 000 000 under budget  I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C. Strange  but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes  while he will double &amp; triple them  a disaster! Wages in are country are too low  good jobs are too few   and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now! Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone  shipped to other countries. We now are part time  sad! I WILL FIX! The middle-class has worked so hard  are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband  with his terrible record of women abuse  while playing the women's card on me  she's wrong! I will do far more for women than Hillary  and I will keep our country safe  something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina! Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM  so inappropriate! A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders! Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE! The same people that said I wouldn't run  or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%)  now say I won't beat Hillary. Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop  I will fix this quickly! We have many problems in our house (country!)  and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now  because of me  starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics! Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together  we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done! I am now in Palm Beach  Florida  and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton  a totally flawed candidate  and beating her soundly Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign  I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone)  I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs! A great Christmas movie &amp; perfect #TBT! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  Story: https://t.co/qUpZphfhV3 https://t.co/PSeVbWUJIV "@ihatematt: @realDonaldTrump why is Hillary even allowed to run... She's a criminal."  Good question! Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity Merry Christmas &amp; Happy Holidays! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/XIVw5LdTqv https://t.co/Sqim2YyoCH Hillary  when you complain about "a penchant for sexism " who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL! It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card. We need a PRESIDENT with strength  stamina  heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again! When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama  it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics! Once again  #MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly. Women defy media narrative  love Trump at packed Michigan rally. VIDEO: https://t.co/yreUny7shA https://t.co/dE9odwIRQi Do you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about "the video" of me being used by ISIS. There is no video. A suicide bomber has just killed U.S. troops in Afghanistan. When will our leaders get tough and smart. We are being led to slaughter! I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. There never was a video. Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant. I sold it 6 months ago for a record price. This would never have happened! .@JebBush today said he didn't want to be the front-runner  he would rather be where he is now  2%. That is the talk of a loser  can't win! Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me. Therefore  Hillary LIED at the debate last night. SAD! Hillary Clinton lied when she said that "ISIS is using video of Donald Trump as a recruiting tool." This was fact checked by @FoxNews: FALSE #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/7FkgBAqF4A President Obama spends so much time speaking of the so-called Carbon footprint  and yet he flies all the way to Hawaii on a massive old 747. See  Sanders backed Hillary on E-mails at the debate  hurting himself  and then she threw him under the bus (but failed). Disloyal person! Thank you for all of your support! Most importantly - we need to get everyone out to VOTE! #VoteTrump2016 https://t.co/ezCsk3cWaJ The last thing our country needs is another BUSH! Dumb as a rock! #ISIS is making $400M/year on oil.

Is Obama profiling? Well  Obama refused to say (he just can't say it)  that we are at WAR with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS. Wish Obama would say ISIS  like almost everyone else  rather than ISIL.

In case of doubt we should report to the Police and do everything to locate the parents and restore the child to them. Whenever we see a child begging anywhere  we should make efforts to find out who that child is ? Has the child been kidnapped like Sangita ?

We request the Government to bring in a very stringent law to deal with the menace of kidnapping of children in the country. Lakhs of young children are kidnapped every year.

I am participating in the discussion. Shri Pranab Mukherjee has called an all party meeting in the Parliament House tomorrow at 9.30 am. We are attending the meeting. Back in Delhi after a hectic tour of my constituency. My speech in Lok Sabha on Bhopal Gas tragedy on 11.8.2010 http://t.co/qitmVUvA We must provide for effective safeguards for our country and people. As we are opening the country to multinationals  we should also remember the Bhopal gas tragedy. Unfortunately the guilty men of this tragedy have gone scot free. US multinationals are not prepared to remove even the industrial waste. Union Carbide left 15 000 dead. Even third generation is suffering the physical disabilities. The ground water is contaminated. I am in Bhopal today. It is twenty seven years of Bhopal gas tragedy - the biggest industrial disaster in the world. There is stalemate in the Parliament because Government is not prepared for a discussion followed by a vote. This means that at the end of discussion  the country may know whether Parliament approves or does not approve of Government's decision. After all what is that we are asking ? Please have discussion by way of an adjournment motion because it provides for a discussion and vote. We are asking for a discussion under the rules which provide for discussion and vote. Is that wrong  unparliamentary or unconstitutional ? Why is the Government shying away from a vote in the House ? Therefore  we are pressing for our adjournment motion because that is a device where a discussion is followed by a vote in the House. We want to take this discussion to a logical conclusion. That can be done only through a vote in the House. Government says it is ready for a discussion on FDI in retail. We do not want a discussion that is talked out. This means the Government does not have the majority support in the Parliament on this decision. Why is the Government running away from a discussion followed by a vote in the House ? We want a discussion in the Parliament on our adjournment motion on FDI in retail. He should first convince them before commenting on the Opposition opposition. His cabinet  his party  his alliance partners  his supporting parties - nobody is with this decision. Trinamool Congress DMK leaders spoke against this decision in the All party meeting today. UPA supporting parties SP and BSP are in complete of Kerala state has gone public saying they have sent him a letter opposing this decision. His colleagues AK Antony and Jairam Ramesh opposed this decision in the cabinet. His party is not with this decision. Congress President of The passing away of Assamese writer Mrs Indira Goswami is an irreparable loss to the world of literature. My heartfelt condolences We want the House to discuss this issue by way of adjournment motion tomorrow. Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi has submitted a notice of Adjournment Motion on behalf of BJP.Other opposition parties have also moved such motions. They bypass the Parliament. We cannot accept this. They should have discussed this issue in the Parliament and taken a decision in accordance with the sense of the House. It is a contempt of the House. Parliament is in session and Government announced a decision of such far reaching consequences outside the Parliament. I am sorry it is Congress members who disrupt the House and Pranabda is appealing to the opposition. Nobody from Cong tried to control them and House had to be adjourned. I tried to pursuade them to let the House function but they did not listen. . Congress members started shouting slogans and disrupted the House. I am sorry to say that Finance Minister Shri Pranab Mukherjee was not present in the House. All opposition leaders were present in the House for discussion on price rise at 2 PM on Thursday. and adjournment motion on blackmoney was to be taken up on Monday ? Does he remember that there was a consesus in his presence that the price rise be discussed at 2 PM on thursday I wish to ask Pranab Da : Who stalled the Parliament on thursday afternoon ? Martyrdom day of Guru Tegh Bahadur ji. We are all indebted to the great Guru who made supreme sacrifice for us. In spite of our best efforts  the Government is not allowing the House to function and discuss price rise and black money. Congress Party made no efforts to control its members and the House was adjourned for the day. We reiterated our support for Telangana and requested Congress members to allow discussion on price rise. We pleaded with the agitated members that BJP was all for Telangana. Congress members from Telangana region carrying placard shouted slogans and did not allow the House to function. Parliamentary affairs Minister was also absent. In fact no Cabinet Minister was present. Today when discussion on price rise was to start at 2 PM the Finance Minister was not present in the House. There was a consensus for discussion on price rise at 2 PM today. The adjournment motion on black money was agreed for Monday. It appears the Government is not interested in running the House. I strongly condemn the attack of Shri Sharad Pawar. This is an act of madness. BJP Parliamentary Party meeting at 9.30 am today Price rise and black money are the two major issues.

We met Prime Minister in this regard on 21st October.We are sorry Central Government has not taken effective steps for lifting the blockade. Despite news reports  the economic blockade in Manipur continues for 100 days today. I will raise this in the coming session of Parliament. Government needs to wake up. It is unfortunate that even after 64 years of independence  we are not able to provide safe drinking water to our people. As many as 6 lac people from 885 villages of Nalgonda are affected. 10 000 people are bedridden. The ground water in Nalgonda district has 6-8PPM of Fluoride. The safe limit is 1 PPM. His doctoral thesis was "Proposals for Preparing India's Basic Education to Use Audio-Visual Techniques in Adult Education". I knew Bhupen da well.

Live telecast of my Nalgonda meeting at http://t.co/yqMl1cyI We must prevent such blockades in future. We are one country. The economic blockade of any part of the country is wrong and unjustified. We requested him to take effective steps for lifting the blockade. We met the Prime Minister in this regard on 21st October and expressed our serious concern. I am happy to know that the 92 day long economic blockade in Manipur has come to an end. This has been the longest economic blockade. छट पर्व की शुभकामनाएं. यह सूर्य उपासना का पर्व है. ॐ सूर्याय नमः Sardar Patel's jayanti today. India remembers the Iron man with gratitude.

Some English papers have also written about him in detail सियासी सुर्खिओं के बीच एक साहित्यकार को इतनी भावभीनी श्रद्धांजलि देकर मीडिया ने अपनी ज़िम्मेदारी को पूरी तरह निभाया है. कुछ अंग्रेजी अख़बारों ने भी विस्तार से शुक्ल जी के बारे में लिखा है. इन लेखों में उनकी लगभग सभी विधाओं को उभारा गया है. और नई पीढ़ी को उनकी प्रखर लेखन प्रतिभा से परिचित कराया गया है. आज के हिंदी अख़बारों में छपे श्रीलाल शुक्ल जी के प्रति श्रद्धांजलि देने वाले लेख पढ़ कर  मन अभिभूत हुआ. His departure is an irreparable loss to Hindi literature. Sorry to know about the sad demise of Shrilal Shukla ji - the great Hindi writer.

That day Parliament could not function on account of repeated police atrocities in Delhi and  brutal killing of farmers in Maharashtra. We are a responsible opposition party accountable to the people. This was distorted and reported as "We will decide on the functioning of the Parliament" My answer was "this is for today. We meet every morning to decide on the strategy for the day." A question was asked 'Shall BJP stall the Parliament till the Home Minister resigned ?' The 3rd was brutal lathicharge on Yuva Morcha workers in which more than 40 workers incl one who is physically challenged suffered fractures The second was midnight crackdown on Baba Ramdev supporters in which Rajbala is permanently disabled. We cited three recent examples of Police atrocities like the brutal lathi charge on Delhi BJP workers in which a BJP worker lost his eye. Let me explain the background. We demanded the resignation of Home Minister on account of repeated police atrocities on citizens in Delhi. The news report in Hindu dated 11th Aug quoting me as saying 'We will decide on functioning of Parliament' is a distorted report. Government has suspended some policemen. Is that enough ? Four persons have been killed including a woman Sarpanch and a child. Shocking visuals of Police firing at farmers near Pune. We will raise the issue of Police atrocities on citizens in the Parliament tomorrow. Three people have been killed in police firing. The three include a woman and a child. In Maharshtra  Police fired on the farmers today. In the recent past  Delhi Police has committed similar brutalities on Delhi BJP workers and Swami Ramdev supporters. Most of them have fractures and serious injuries. More than 40 BJP Yuva Morcha workers are admitted in Ram Manohar Lohia hospital.

My Call attention motion for separate Telangana is listed for tomorrow at 12 noon. Our categoric position is that Prime Minister should also be within the ambit of the Lokpal Bill. We opposed the introduction because Prime Minister has been kept out of the purview of Lokpal Bill. Government introduced the Lokpal Bill in Lok Sabha today. Finance Minister will reply to debate on price rise today at 12 noon. It is likely to come up on Friday 5th Aug at 12 noon.

Had a very good meeting with Mrs Hillary R Clinton US Secretary of State at my residence today. The wounds of 26/11 have not yet healed and we again have serial blasts in Mumbai. We must prevent this. This requires some determined steps on our part. We must introspect as a nation and find out as to what is wrong and where. The routine statement of describing this as 'an act of cowardice' will not help. She is now practising in Delhi. Our only child is a daughter Bansuri. She is a Barrister from Inner Temple.

He was Governor of MIzoram for three years (1990-93).He holds the distinction of being youngest Governor in the country at 37 years of age. Swaraj ji was designated as a Senior Advocate by Supreme Court of India in 1986 and became the first Advocate General of Mizoram. I was elected to Haryana Assembly in 1977 and became the youngest Cabinet Minister in the country at the age of 25 years. I got married to Swaraj Kaushal in 1975. We were both practising lawyers before Supreme Court of India. 13 July - Today is our wedding annniversary. The reshuffle has been done without much thought and consideration. Madhya Pradesh has got a raw deal in this reshuffle. Kanti Lal Bhuria and Arun Yadav both have been dropped. The annoyance of the major allliance partner puts a question mark on the stability of this Government. DMK has refused to provide replacement for Maran and Raja. Prime Minister has undermined the importance of these two departments. The temporary is now permanent. The country was hoping that in the present reshuffle  the departments will have separate Cabinet Ministers. HRD and Telecom are both very important departments. After Raja's ouster Telecom was given as additional charge to HRD Minister temporarily. The present reshuffle by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has done just the opposite. Normally a cabinet reshuffle is undertaken to assess performance of Ministers and to correct imbalance amongst states and alliance partners. Pl send your CV to my PS Satish Gupta. His e mail id is 2011vidisha@gmail.com. Those from Vidisha/MP are preferred. It is always a pleasure to train youngsters. We receive many requests for Parliamentary Assistants. Two train accidents in a day is most unfortunate and a matter of serious concern. एक दिन में दो रेल दुर्घटनाएं दुर्भाग्यपूर्ण भी है और गहरी चिंता का विषय भी. In constituency for the last two days.. He died in Srinagar Camp jail under mysterious circumstances on June 23 1953 .Our salute to the great martyr Dr. Shyama Prasad Mookerjee. He protested against a system under which Indian citizens had to obtain a permit to enter J&K. Dr. Mookerjee defied this condition. Dr. Shyama Prasad Mookerjee proclaimed 'India is one nation.We cannot not have two flags  two Constitutions and two Prime Ministers' My shradhanjali to Babu Jagjivan Ram. Babuji was a great administraror. He was a man of very few words and had common sense solution to most of the problems. I got to know him in 1977 when I was Cabinet Minister in Haryana. Babuji was Defence Minister in Morarjibhai Government. Today is the punyatithi of Babu Jagjivan Ram. Our respectful homage to Dr Shyama Prasad Mookerjee. He resigned from the Nehru Cabinet and founded Bharatiya Jana Sangh on October 21  1951. He died in custody in Jammu & Kashmir in 1953. He was a Barrister and became Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University when he was only 33 years of age. 6th July - Dr. Shyama Prasad Mookerjee was born this day in 1901. that "Government should bring an effective and strong Lokpal Bill in the next session by following the established procedure" At the end of the meeting  a unanimous resolution was passed. Parliament may then pass a well considered Lokpal Bill in the winter session. All political parties  state Governments and members of civil society will be able to present their views to the standing committee. We demanded that Government should introduce Lokpal Bill in the coming Monsoon Session of Parliament and send it to the Standing Committee. We want that the Lokpal should be selected in a transparent manner who should be able to function with complete independence. In the All party meeting today  we took a firm stand that we are in favour of an effective and strong Lokpal Bill. I have tweeted in Hindi and English both. Is this alright ? We will apprise them of NDA's decision and request them to reconsider their decision. Shiv Sena did not attend the meeting today because they are in favour of a boycott of PM's meeting. We will speak for a strong and effective Lokpal Bill. NDA leaders met today at 5 pm and decided to participate in the All party meeting called by Prime Minister tomorrow. अभी उन्हें भी NDA के निर्णय से अवगत कराएँगे और पुनर्विचार करने के लिए कहेंगे. शिव सेना ने आज की मीटिंग में भाग नहीं  लिया था क्योंकि वो सर्वदलीय बैठक का बहिष्कार करने के पक्षधर थे. एक सशक्त तथा प्रभावी लोकपाल विधेयक के पक्ष में अपना मत रखेंगे. आज शाम ५ बजे NDA की मीटिंग हुई जिसमे यह निर्णय लिया गया कि  हम कल की प्रधान मंत्री द्वारा बुलाई गई सर्वदलीय बैठक में भाग लेंगे. Shri Anna Hazare and his four colleagues came to BJP Hqs 11 Ashok Road  today to brief senior BJP leaders about their draft of Lokpal Bill. लोकपाल बिल के अपने प्रारूप के बारे  में उन्होंने  बीजेपी नेताओं से बातचीत  की. श्री अन्ना हजारे अपने चार सहयोगिओं सहित आज बीजेपी मुख्यालय में भारतीय जनता पार्टी के शीर्ष नेताओं से मिलने आए. Denmark High Court rejects CBI's request for extradition of Kim Davy. Another embarrassment for the country. डेनमार्क के हाई कोर्ट ने सर्वसम्मति से सीबीआई द्वारा दायर की गयी Kim Davy के प्रत्यर्पण की याचिका ख़ारिज की. एक बार फिर देश की किरकरी हुई. 'China eyes Gilgit's Uranium' - an article by Senge Hasnan in Economic Times today raises some serious issues. Humein bahut chaukanne rahne ki zaroorat hai taaki emergency ka itihas punah na dohraya jaye. Sansadiya sansthayon ke prati unka niradar aur Ramlila maidan mein Police ka taandav iska pratyaksh udahran hain. Aj bhi shaskon mein kuchh vaisi hi pravritiyan deekh rahi hain. Is liye avashyak hai ki unhe iski jankari ho. Aj ki yuva peedi ne na to azadi ki ladai dekhi hai  aur na hi emergency ke baad hui loktantra ki raksha ki ladai dekhi hai. Baahar virodh karne walon ko yatnayein sahni padi. Kaaran ye tha us samay ke shasak kisi bhi tarah satta mein bane rahna chahte the.Is liye nirdosh logon ko 19 maheene jail mein rahna pada. Aaj hi ke din 36 varsh pahle desh mein emergency lagoo ki gayi thi. Aur nagrikon ke jeewan aur azadi ke adhikar smapt ho gaye the. We have to be on guard to see that the history  of emergency does not repeat itself. The scant respect they have for parliamentary institutions and what happened in Ramlila Maidan on 4th June is a clear example of this. The present day rulers are showing similar tendencies. They should be told about this. Our young generation has not seen the freedom struggle.They have not seen the emergency and the country's struggle for democracy. The only reason was that the rulers then wanted to stay in power somehow. Lakhs of innocent people were thrown in jail for 19 long months. Those protesting were subjected to torture and harassment. This day - 36 years back emergency was imposed on the country. Citizens lost their right to life and liberty. Back in Delhi after three days in Tamil Nadu. Meeting with Selvi J Jayalalithaa Chief Minister Tamil Nadu in Chennai. In Tuticorin ( Tamil Nadu ). The victims are housewives  farmers and poorest of the poor. This Government is totally insensitive to the sufferings of the common man.. Congress Government came to power on the slogan 'Congress ka haath aam adami ke saath.'. This is what the common man has got. This is the 10th hike in the prices of petroleum products. The world has to do more to end sea piracy. We will continue to campaign for their release. Unfortunately  39 are still in captivity of Somali pirates. Six of our Sailors from MV Suez are back home after long ordeal. BJP will continue to work at the grass root level  raise issues concerning the people and shall build a strong Party base in the State. So election in the State got completely polarised. there was an overwhelming feeling amongst people to defeat the DMK. The Party candidates felt that although there was all round goodwill for the Party in the State  Over 100 BJP candidates attended. TN BJP canddates and senior leaders met in Chennai today to review the recent Assembly elections. All Party meeting called by Hon'ble Speaker Lok Sabha to discuss  Women's Reservation Bill today at 12 pm. Advani ji and I will attend. In either case it is a matter of grave concern. It is India's Watergate and needs to be thoroughly investigated. Is it that the Government was spying on its own Finance Minister ? Or is it a Corporate House ? Times Now channel has exposed it all. The Finance Minister may have his own compulsions of playing it down. The 'Chewing gum theory' is hard to digest. The news report about bugging of Finance Minister's office is shocking. Back in Delhi. Ashfaqullah Khan sahib the great hero from Shahjahanpur became a martyr at the age of 27 years. बुंदेले हरबोलों के मुँह हमने सुनी कहानी थी  खूब लड़ी मर्दानी वह तो झाँसी वाली रानी थी।। दूर फिरंगी को करने की सबने मन में ठानी थी। चमक उठी सन सत्तावन में  वह तलवार पुरानी थी  सिंहासन हिल उठे राजवंशों ने भृकुटी तानी थी  बूढ़े भारत में आई फिर से नयी जवानी थी  गुमी हुई आज़ादी की कीमत सबने पहचानी थी  Subhadhra Kumari Chauhan wrote in her memory 'Khoob ladi mardani wo to Jhansi wali Rani thi  Bundelo harbolon ke muhn humne suni kahani thi' The life of Rani Jhansi will inspire us for ever. She was born in Kashi on 19 November 1835. She was just 23 when she became a martyr fighting the British. June 18 - Rani Laxmi Bai attained martyrdom this day.. I should say Umaji visited my house for 'Phalahaar' today as she does not take cereals. Uma Bharatiji visited my house for Lunch today. Congress has taken exception to meeting with Baba Ramdev. My brothers and sisters  Vande matram. I am not the one to be cowed down by such people who do not appreciate our patriotic sentiments. If we sing and dance to the song 'Mera rang de basanti chola' on the samadhi of Shahid Bhagat Singh  will it be an insult to  the martyr ? My question is :  Is singing a song in praise of your motherland an insult to Mahatama Gandhi ? Our party workers were singing this song to express their determination to safeguard the freedom and liberty of our country. This means  'this is a country of brave people  distinguished and youthful people How great is this country.  It is a jewel of the world'. The lyrics are 'Yeh desh hai veer jawanon ka  albelon ka mastano ka  Is desh ka yaaro kya kahna  ye desh hai dunia ka gahna'. This song does not require any occasion or event to celebrate.This is a song in praise of our motherland. Congress Party now says that I have not clarified as to what were we celebrating. I was asked to step in. I did this as an act  of comraderie for a brief moment. The media is playing that short clip again and again. Our party workers were singing and dancing on 'Ye desh hai veer jawano ka.' Now they are opposed to all patriotic songs. Earlier they felt ashamed on singing Vande matram. Those who do not like this suffer from mental slavery.. Those who do not like this suffer from mental slavery.. Pahle wo Vande matram ka virodh karte the  ab unhe rashtrbhakti ka koi bhi geet nahi suhata. Jinhe ye pasand nahi aa raha wo log ghulami ki mansikta se grast hain. Hum deshbakt log hain. Apni zindagi ki akhri saans tak hum deshbakti ke geet gayenge bhi  un pr jhoomenge bhi aur nachenge bhi. I am shocked to read Prime Minister's statement that 'crackdown in Ramlila grounds was unfortunate but there was no alternative.' I am shocked that this is the sole clipping picked up as representative visual of the Satyagraha and is being repeatedly telecast This was around 2 in the morning. I stepped in for a brief moment to boost the morale of our Party workers. In keeping with this tradition  I was asked to join in when Party workers were singing and dancing to the song 'Ye desh he veer jawano ka' Senior Party leaders also join in as an expression of comraderie with the Party workers. It is the tradition of our Party that we sing patriotic songs during all our protests and shivirs to keep up spirit of our workers. There were serious political speeches by BJP leaders from 7 pm yesterday till midnight. Then there was a complete misrepresentation in the media about our Satyagraha. On the first day there was complete blackout in media though the entire leadership of principal opposition party was protesting at Rajghat. Back from a successful Satyagraha at Rajghat to protest against Govts crackdown on innocent people peacefully protesting at RamLila grounds. We demanded that a special session of Parliament be convened to discuss the present situation in the country. We called on the President of India Smt Pratibha Patil in Rashtrapati Bhawan today. We are calling on Rashtrapatiji at 12.30 pm today. We are sitting on  Dharna for 24 hous at Rajghat against crackdown in Ram Lila grounds last night. Just spoke to Swami Ram Dev on phone. Tirupatiamma had both her legs fractured. She has left for her home town. Sadguru Shivacharya is continuing the fast holding Tricolour. He is refusing even water. There are patients who are continuing their fast and are refusing even water. Dr. JV Singh of Patanjali Yogpeeth is also injured and admitted in hospital. There are many patients with multiple fractures. Sunil also has his skull fractured. Unfortunately there is a blood clot in his brain. The skull bone of Ravinder is fractured. As many as 69 people were brought to LNJP Hospital with injuries. Let me tell you more about  police brutalities at Ram Lila Maidan. Shri Arun Jaitley and I are addressing a Press Conference at BJP Headquarters here. I am going to 11 Ashok Road. Will let you know more about police brutalities here. Rajbala from Gurgaon is in ICU. Her spine is fractured. She is paralysed for life. There are two other patients with neuro injuries. Some have their bones fractured. There are 35 injured in LNJP hospital. Shri Arun Jaitley and I are addressing a Press Conference today at 12.30pm at BJP Headquarters 11 Ashok Road. Lucknow - National Executive meeting of Bharatiya Janata Party May God give courage to the Badal family to bear this loss. Malout (Panjab) - antim ardas in memory of Mrs Surinder Kaur Badal  wife of S.Prakash Singh Badal  Chief Minister  Panjab. My speech on 2 yrs of UPA Govt in Delhi on 1st June @ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EDdzBSq4so   This is Part II of my speech My speech on 2 yrs of UPA Govt in Delhi on 1st June  @ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlRzdgHGd14      This is Part I of my speech Addressed Public meeting organised by BJP Delhi State in Mavalankar Hall  Rafi Marg on 2 years of UPA. Our film fraternity should do everything possible for his treatments so that he can lead a normal life. We should make all efforts to bring him back to India. Unfortunately  he is in a mental asylum in America. It is a matter of great satisfaction that Actor Raj Kiran has been traced after ten long years. Jhansi Rani was a promising BJP leader from Telangana. We lost her at a very young age in a road accident in February this year. In Hyderabad My respectful homage to the memory of Jhansi Rani.She was the Veeragana(valiant  leader)of Telangana.This is my first visit after her demise Joint Action Committee members present in full strength. Addressed a huge public meeting organised by BJP in Baba Saheb Ambedkar Stadium Karimnagar for Telangana State. My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. The crash of Air Ambulance in Faridabad is extremely shocking. May God give strength to the bereaved Badal family to bear this loss. May her soul rest in peace. We could not take off due to poor visibility at Bhatinda airport. I am sorry  I am unable to attend her funeral. Advaniji  Menaka Gandhi and I have just returned from Airport. I had known her since 1977 when I became a Cabinet Minister in Haryana. She was a lady full of life and personal warmth. My heartfelt condolences on the sad demise of Mrs Surinder Kaur Badal wife of Sardar Prakash Singh Badal. I am happy the NHRC team is visiting Bhatta Parsaul today. We had demanded this. We are not surprised. But we happy that this finding has come from an Investigative agency. The CBI has found no wrong-doing in the allocation of spectrum during his tenure as Telecom Minister in the NDA regime. I am extremely happy to see the report in Economic Times today 24th May titled 'CBIs CLEAN CHIT TO SHOURIE IN SPECTRUM ALLOCATION CASE.' Blooper after blooper. I am tired saying that the Government is embarrassing the country. Let us wait until the whole list is scrutinised. Our Government hs made us a laughing stock before the whole world. Another goof up. Feroze serial number 24 in India's Most wanted list given to Pakistan is in Mumbai jai. To err is Government of India. Is anybody accountable in this Government ? The Home Minister has embarrassed the country. The inclusion of the name of Wazhul Khan in India's MOST WANTED list submitted to Pakistan is an unpardonable mistake. I appreciate the sensitivity and compassion of our Courts to prevent cruelty to animals. Thank u Hindu (May 15) for reporting this. I am a strong supporter of animal rights. As a family we are strict vegetarians. We are vegetarian by conviction as also by tradition. True. This earth belongs to birds and animals as much as it belongs to us. Hon'ble Judge says 'to keeep birds in cages is violation of their right to live in free air/sky'. I am deeply touched by the judgment of Justice M.R.Shah of Gujarat High Court  directing release of 494 birds held captive in cages. Supreme Court has directed release of 5 million tonnes of foodgrains in 150 poorest districts to prevent starvation deaths and malnutrition. Supreme has felt the pain of the poor of this country. The nation is grateful to Justice Dalveer Bhandari and Justice Deepak Verma for this great judgement. There is absolutely no justification in allowing foodgrains to rot while people die of starvation. Thank u friends. National Human Rights Commission should immediately act and send a team to these villages. Men have left the villages. There is repression on women and children. How can an elected Government allow this ? The visuals of farmers agitation in Western UP are shocking. This should not happen in a democratic country. I am in constant touch with the authorities. Fortunately  there is no casualty. Six passengers are seriously injured. They are being treated in Hamidia Hospital Bhopal. Udyog Nagari Train accident - I have spoken to Chief Minister  Distt Collector Vidisha and DRM Bhopal. In Constituency for four days. He set up Santiniketan - a great institution of learning. I believe Santiniketan was the first coeducational institution in the country. 7th May - we commemorate the 150th anniversary of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore. We must devise a stricter air safety code to prevent recurrence of such incidents in future. My sympathies for the bereaved families. I am sorry to know about the demise of Shri Dorjee Khandu  Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh. The co-passengers have also died in crash. No clue as yet. Shameful. I am glued to Television for fourth day now - just waiting to know about the well being of Dorjee Khandu Chief Minister of ArunachalPradesh. We should entrust this task to Army and Air Force. It is third day today - we have not been able to locate our Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh. Most unfortunate. President Obama has confirmed the death of Osama Bin Laden. He was humanity's enemy number one. I have just told Navika Kumar that I have not made any such statement. I have not made any such statement. I am in Mangalore attending Fishermen's conference. Breaking News that Times Now is carrying quoting me is not correct. We have identified issues relating to fishermen. We will raise them in the Parliament. In Mangalore - to address National Convention for fisherman of West Coast organised by BJP Fishermen Cell. In Bengaluru since yesterday. What happened in the PAC meeting yesterday reminds me of emergency days when parliamentary institutions were subverted. In Thiruvananthapuram - Condolence meeting in memory of Shri B K Shekhar BJP leader and candidate from TVM I hope the  institutions founded by him will continue the great work of charity and welfare of people. The demise of Shri Sathya Sai Baba is a terrible loss. He dedicated his life in the service of mankind. Public meeting in Barha Bazar Kolkata Campaigning in West Bengal. Impressive meetings in Hingalganj and Uluberia Purba. I will be addressing National Convention for fisherman of West Coast organised by BJP Fishermen Cell in Mangalore on 29th & 30th April 2011. I am in my Constituency for the last three days. I am very  sad and upset over the demise of Sh. B.K.Shekhar  our candidate from TVM. He was a very promising leader.. My interview in Nai Duniya http://twitdoc.com/5UY I wish Arunima a speedy recovery. The culprits should also be brought to book. I am pursuing the matter relating to killing of our fishermen by Srilankan Navy with the Government. We will spare no effort in this regard. He has promised to ascertain facts and revert at the earliest. I have  just spoken to Shri SM Krishna Minister for External Affairs in Bangalore regarding TN fishermen killed by Srilankan Navy. Our TN State President  Pon. Radhakrishnan is going to Rameswaram. I have just spoken to Shri Mohan Rajlu Org Secy BJP TN. Our State Secy is going there immediately. mbalaji101 has informed that 4 fishermen from Rameswaram hv been killed by Srilankan navy.Pl give me details. I will definitely raise this. 16th April - Jai Jinendra.

Get to your caucus location early and join history in the making. https://t.co/BBtQLA27Xu We need to federally fund and require body cameras for law enforcement officers to make it easier to hold them accountable. Violence and brutality  particularly at the hands of the police  is unacceptable and must not be tolerated.

More info here: https://t.co/eJGkfGKaXk #BernieInSeattle For the last 40 years the great middle class of our country — once the envy of the world — has been disappearing. We have more people in jail than any other country. Lives are destroyed as we spend $80 billion locking up fellow Americans. A handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power. In 2008  their illegal behavior nearly destroyed the global economy. Virtually every Republican candidate for president wants us to believe Social Security is in crisis and must be cut. They are dead wrong. Millions of Americans lost their life savings after 2008  but Social Security was right there paying full benefits. Wyoming! Tomorrow is your last chance to register to vote. Please visit https://t.co/9uz1j8VhLv to find out how. The decision to have an abortion is for a woman to make  not the Governor of Indiana.  https://t.co/1VOroXS2br We need to re-enfranchise the more than 5 million Americans who have had their right to vote taken away by a felony conviction. New York! Tomorrow is your last chance to register to vote. Please visit https://t.co/lE0xbWnAOn to find out how. On Tuesday night  people waited in line for 5 hours to vote. We don't know how many didn't get to cast their ballots. This is unacceptable. I'm glad to see @MayorStanton asking @TheJusticeDept to investigate the voting delays in Arizona.  https://t.co/Ic5x3Sm7iB The system is rigged when the average person works longer hours for lower wages  and 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. Big pharma cannot continue to evade taxes while ripping off Americans who already pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world. It's time to end discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. This law has no place in America. https://t.co/uINi5KpsZ6 My plan: break up big banks  close tax loopholes and make them pay their fair share. Then we can expand health care and make college free. As president  I will fight attempts to undercut Roe v. Wade. We must protect and expand a woman's right to abortion. As president  I will stand with Native Americans in the struggle to protect their treaty and sovereign rights. https://t.co/6aiDgyJ6h3 Bernie is on LIVE right now with @TheYoungTurks. Tune in here: https://t.co/TuyuWwxFgv The goal of U.S. military policy must be to destroy ISIS  but to do it in a way that does not get U.S. troops involved in perpetual warfare. As president  I will defend this nation but I will do it responsibly. I voted against the war in Iraq and that was the right vote. Smile! We're making a new ad and want to include videos of what makes this campaign historic: YOU! Submit yours: https://t.co/6gvDEVHMK9 😀 No  we’re not gonna deny coverage for contraception or any other procedure because an employer has a “moral” objection to it. #HandsOffMyBC We are not going back to the days when women did not have full access to birth control. #HandsOffMyBC Trump thinks we should not raise the minimum wage. He wants to give billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthy. I don't think so. It is time for the U.S. government to treat Native American tribes with respect and dignity. https://t.co/4cawYXHqxo We need policies that bring us together and create a middle class that works for all of us rather than an economy that works for just a few. Thank you Idaho for our second big win of the night! https://t.co/TieswEhPJP Thank you to all those who caucused tonight in Utah! https://t.co/rOyeNApj2R Tune in live to our Future to Believe In Rally in San Diego here: https://t.co/alN6POkSfY If you're in Arizona  make sure to stay in line.

We are fighting a terrorist organization killing innocent people. We are not fighting a religion. We have got to do everything we can to make certain that a Republican does not occupy the White House. https://t.co/IBuBAMXqwr There is no question that you are looking at the strongest Democratic candidate.  https://t.co/e8vn0gbsLj Arizona  we need your help! After you vote today  ask the clerk for the turnout at your precinct and report it: https://t.co/baGDKnEkhd Not only would we beat Donald Trump in Utah  we would beat him badly. Utah: vote to win the White House. https://t.co/UcfLTRK3qN Arizona  Utah and Idaho — It's your turn to vote for our political revolution. Grab your friends and family and go out and vote. We offer our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones in this barbaric attack and to the people of Brussels. Our nation has always been a refuge for the oppressed. We need to take steps to protect families seeking refuge here  not cast them out. Smile! We're making new ads and want to include videos of what makes this campaign historic: YOU! Submit your video: https://t.co/0o3clzPnIf Don’t know that I’d call President Obama's 72 straight months of job growth an “awful legacy.” https://t.co/GUzlY6Wp4h Wonder how many $27 contributions @HillaryClinton got at her fundraiser hosted by the NRA lobbyist: https://t.co/w8IHpJ5Vo6 Universal health care is an idea that has been supported by Democratic presidents going back to Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. It's time to shut the revolving door between Wall Street and the government. Wall Street will not be represented in my administration. I believe Israel  Palestine and the international community can  must and will rise to do what needs to be done to achieve a lasting peace. Early in this campaign you turned out more people for events than any other campaign. Let's GOTV! #ForThePeople https://t.co/QxvL4WYjVj Despite what the media tells you  politics is not a soap opera. Politics is about coming together to improve the lives of all. #ForThePeople When we stand together  we win. #ForThePeople https://t.co/1TOSPahofI Arizona  Idaho and Utah vote and caucus tomorrow! We have a good chance to win if we stand together. #ForThePeople https://t.co/r1tZ3eH8zu As president  I will appoint justices to the Supreme Court who understand the importance of preserving Roe v. Wade. Our political revolution is now resonating all over the world. Thank you  Democrats abroad! https://t.co/X8Dvc9d1Kr I applaud President Obama for traveling to Cuba and moving relations between our two countries into a new era. https://t.co/DFwOy6ytXx When we come together and don’t allow people to divide us  we can create an economy that works for all and not just the top 1 percent. The recklessness  greed and illegal behavior of Wall Street drove this country into the worst economic downturn in modern history. Thank you  Seattle! If every person here brings a friend and a family member out to vote  we will win on Saturday! https://t.co/JfMSGsQARP We cannot and we should not even be talking about sweeping up millions of men  women  and children and throwing them out of the country. In a democratic society  politics should not be treated like a baseball game or a soap opera. We need discussion about serious issues. We invaded Iraq 13 years ago today. We must ask ourselves: are we more or less safe because of that war? Utah  join the political revolution. Caucus for Bernie on Tuesday  March 22. #ByThePeople https://t.co/GJ8SaK738t Idaho  want real change? Caucus on Tuesday for Bernie Sanders. Bring your friends and family with you! #ByThePeople https://t.co/rBRRLblqf7 Let us see Arizona help lead a political revolution #ByThePeople. Go out and vote on Tuesday. https://t.co/9q00aR2Eff I talked to a young man serving in the US military and while he was serving his country  his wife was deported. That's beyond comprehension. Wall Street is terrified because we are running a campaign that does not support their agenda. We represent working families. #ByThePeople We're gonna make a political revolution and we're gonna transform America. #ByThePeople https://t.co/x3xboCm6eI This campaign is a political revolution #ByThePeople  and we must make sure that health care is a right  not a privilege. Change will not come without political participation. Join us: https://t.co/DgLPXFVwaM #ByThePeople https://t.co/biD0gPaxdm No one said a political revolution would be easy. We're up against a billionaire class determined to see us lose. #ByThePeople YOU are the reason we have done so well against the political establishment and its super PACs. And you're how Bernie will win. #ByThePeople Arizona  Idaho and Utah are up on Tuesday. We have a good chance to win if we stand together.  #ByThePeople https://t.co/UyfO8oe5jt This is a campaign of the people  #ByThePeople and for the people.  https://t.co/DgLPXFVwaM https://t.co/QpTiMiloug We don't need a bigger wall or more barbed wire. We need a humane immigration policy that keeps families together.  https://t.co/CBInCSCwZ4 Despite growing poverty among seniors  Republicans want more austerity for the elderly and more tax breaks for the rich. Together we're going to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision which has allowed millionaires to buy politicians. "Bernie is not a politician of convenience. He understands that the powerless need a voice.” - @StandWithRaul https://t.co/YskFXvGzOc The idea that a mother is living here and her children are living on the other side of a nation's border is wrong and immoral. Raids are not the answer. We cannot continue to employ inhumane tactics involving rounding up and deporting thousands of immigrant families. As families across this country continue to struggle to make ends meet  we must fight for fair wages for all. I'm running for president because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. We need a political revolution. Real change comes when large numbers of Americans get involved in the democratic process. Take action: https://t.co/3FBeSbNbXW #OfThePeople The struggle for our rights isn’t the struggle of a day or a year. It’s the struggle of a lifetime. #OfThePeople https://t.co/MH415p8E6O When we all stand together for justice  we win. When working families stand together  we win. #OfThePeople Our campaign is being called the most serious threat to establishment politics in a generation. They ain’t seen nothing yet. #OfThePeople I will lead the effort for comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship. https://t.co/LkF5jvbeXN This campaign is gaining momentum because we are listening to the pain #OfThePeople.  They want real change! Touring the border here in Nogales  Arizona. I'm struck by the fear and sadness that grips so many families. https://t.co/QjsG9iN9sp Pope Francis has said we should be building more bridges  not more walls. Pope Francis is right. https://t.co/L3tnApwNGQ I'm asking people across the nation to come together and organize an unprecedented grassroots movement. #OfThePeople https://t.co/3FBeSbNbXW This is a campaign #OfThePeople  by the people  and for the people.  https://t.co/3FBeSbNbXW https://t.co/zuwO3mgjK3 We can live in a nation where if you work 40 hours a week  you know that your child is able to go to college regardless of your income. Vote for the political revolution. #GetMillennialsToVoteIn5Words Boeing gets 40 percent of the money discharged by the Export-Import Bank. And let me tell you  Boeing ain't exactly a small business. Today  you've got child care workers making minimum wage. That is crazy. We should value our child care workers more than that. On Tuesday there is going to be a very important caucus in Utah. We'll win that caucus if there is a large turnout.  https://t.co/6IxDgLSFAo We can have differences about when to go to war  but there should be no debate about the benefits our veterans have earned. #DefendTheGIBill We need a government that works for all of us and not just wealthy campaign contributors. https://t.co/wo51mle8S1 Washington: If you can’t attend your caucus  today is the last day to mail-in your ballot! Visit https://t.co/WCU826GxNh for more info! Sec. Clinton says she got to travel the world. Did she happen to notice that every major country guarantees health care to all their people? A grassroots movement by the numbers: ✅ Nearly 2 million donors ✅ More than 5.7 million contributions ✅ Average contribution: $27 I don't take corporate PAC money  and if  by some accident  some company sent us money  we would send it back—absolutely. We cannot jail our way out of health problems like drug addiction or social and economic problems like poverty. How is it that tens of thousands of bright young people today are unable to go to college because they can’t afford it? That's unacceptable. I believe that morally and ethically we do not have a right to turn our backs on veterans who are sleeping out on the street. I want to end the sad reality of having more people in jail than any other country. I'd rather we have the best educated population. There needs to be a path back from prison. We need real education and real skills training for the incarcerated. This is why my plan to #ActOnClimate starts by keeping fossil fuels in the ground. https://t.co/5SRJark0nD https://t.co/gCEY1tmIzt Sec. Clinton has a super PAC raising huge amounts of money from Wall Street and the fossil fuel industry. I am doing it a different way. How did we have so much money to go to war in Iraq but somehow we don't have enough to rebuild the pipes in Flint? #FlintWaterCrisis Here’s a radical idea: We're going to create an economy that works for working families  not just the billionaires! If patriotism means anything  it means that we do not turn our backs on those veterans who have who defended us. We don’t have billionaires waiting in the wings with bags of cash. This campaign is led by people like you. Donate: https://t.co/zpWlDRrORo If you're a kid caught with marijuana  you get a record. If you're an exec on Wall St. that destroyed the economy  you get off scot-free. I don’t believe you can take on climate change effectively while taking money from those who would profit off the destruction of the planet. The United States is the only developed nation in the world without guaranteed  paid parental leave. We must guarantee these benefits. We need trade agreements that protect and benefit working families  not just the CEOs of large corporations. People do not like the idea that our politicians have become dependent on billionaires and super PACs for money. We can change this system. The test of a great nation is not how many wars it can engage in  but how it can resolve international conflicts in a peaceful manner. I am not just asking for your vote. I am asking for you to get involved in a political revolution. Join us: https://t.co/T3B7Rc1rUT The Koch brothers and their billionaire allies don’t just want to cut Social Security  they want to eliminate Social Security. No one said the political revolution would be easy. We’re facing a billionaire class set on seeing us lose. Donate: https://t.co/LOWlJVWP9m Between our government’s unwillingness to negotiate prices and its failure to fight fraud  it’s no wonder drug prices are out of control. Families are struggling to put bread on the table and take care of their basic needs. America needs a political revolution. Our disastrous trade policies for the past 30 or 40 years have had a horrendous impact on the lives of millions of working Americans. The greed of the billionaire class is destroying this country and whether they like it or not we are going to stop that greed. Do not settle for the status quo when the status quo is broken. https://t.co/By9Ypi3HJ9 My plan would create a clean-energy workforce of 10 million good-paying jobs by creating a 100% clean-energy system. https://t.co/rGsrmm6Za4 Seen in Chicago. https://t.co/96pr0yd6QI Last chance to head to the polls!

When you vote  ask a poll worker for your precinct's turnout number and report it: https://t.co/hhT0CSbayO. Ready for a political revolution? Get out and vote! Text VOTE to 82623 for voting information. #PrimaryDay https://t.co/oebM3EyYrg This government belongs to all of us  not just a wealthy few. Vote for Bernie today and use #iVoted to share! https://t.co/MBfy893kly Today is an incredibly important day for our movement. Can you call voters today and get them to the polls? https://t.co/aTpBHlAr7O Sisters and brothers in Ohio  Illinois  North Carolina  Missouri and Florida: make your voice heard today. Go vote. #VoteTogether This is an historic triumph for the future of our planet over powerful fossil-fuel interests. https://t.co/liF0HgYrCe Locking up addicts is not going to solve the problem. Substance abuse and addiction are health issues not criminal issues. Vampire Weekend's Ezra Koenig and Chris Tomson #FeelTheBern and want you to go out and VOTE for Bernie tomorrow. https://t.co/QFTbC7Wnvj I don't have a super PAC and I don't travel the country begging millionaires to contribute to my campaign. This is a grassroots campaign. Idaho is ready to caucus for Bernie on March 22. Thanks for the huge march on Saturday! https://t.co/hJrOjE7Dtc https://t.co/LQNbrDH3A3 This campaign is proving that you can run for office without taking money from corporate America and special interests. #GrassrootsMovement My plan provides $41 billion in transition assistance to ALL fossil fuel workers  not just coal workers.  https://t.co/rGsrmlPoiw Millions of Americans who want to join unions are unable to do so because of the coercive and often illegal behavior of their employers. Thank you Tobey Giat for participating in democracy and for your help on my campaign. We can't do this without you.  https://t.co/3ijdlZ8vrp If you want a candidate who will defeat Trump or some other Republican  you are looking at him. https://t.co/KYDuadpfa5 When we talk about war  we must talk about the 500 000 men and women who came home with PTSD  and traumatic brain injury. Today  shamefully  the United States has the highest childhood poverty rate of nearly any major country on earth. https://t.co/KbkLxeu3FS .@HillaryClinton should stop taking NRA lobbyist money. https://t.co/w8IHpIOjZw America needs a president who will stand up to the fossil fuel industry and tell them their profits are not more important than the planet. With so much violence already in the world  I just don't think the state itself should be killing people. I'm against capital punishment. When we talk about education  we should talk about the great teachers in this country and make sure they get a good wage. #DemTownHall We're gonna raise our minimum wage to a living wage so that nobody who works 40 hours a week in America is living in poverty. #DemTownHall No candidate running for president is more committed to strengthening HBCUs than Bernie Sanders. #DemTownHall https://t.co/K59X71lLQE Like any other public official  when a police officer breaks the law  that officer must be held accountable. #DemTownHall Violence is not acceptable in the American political process. We should condemn violence not encourage it. #DemTownhall Wonderful meeting with many prominent leaders of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in Illinois. https://t.co/3jPwYE39a0 The American people don’t need a president who says the right things in a stump speech. They need a president who is with them every day. Trump should tone down his rhetoric and condemn the violence of some of his supporters. https://t.co/HfYL3hoMqk "We need you Obi-Wan." - @DannyDeVito introducing Bernie in St. Louis before Missouri's primary on Tuesday. https://t.co/W7XrF0FLdS Today in the United States the top 1 percent earns more income than the bottom 50 percent. Does that make sense? We should be investing in small businesses and worker-owned enterprises that want to create jobs in the United States of America. I have spent my career fighting for something that I consider to be a human right. That human right is health care. The United States must join the rest of the industrialized world and provide health care as a right to every man  woman and child. I have a message for Secretary Clinton: We don't need to tinker with the TPP trade agreement. We need to defeat it.  https://t.co/d54iNVeF6V We cannot be the only major country on earth which does not guarantee paid vacation time and paid sick time. Effort under way right now by @hillaryclinton and party allies to steal Polk County Iowa conv. election Bernie won earlier today. Rahm gave the banks what they asked for and now they're making the teachers and children of Chicago pay the price. https://t.co/yIlBf6P9Iu We win when people come together. We win when we reject division. Good to be back in Chicago. https://t.co/BEcKGiju3m "Every American  regardless of their income  should have access to a college education.” - @TroyLaRaviere https://t.co/S1Nm9HS2No Every veteran who defends this nation must get the quality health care and benefits they have earned and receive the respect they deserve. I'm asking young people to be leaders in this country. Help us create a nation where every person realizes their full promise of equality. We will continue to bring people together. We will not allow the Donald Trumps of the world to divide us up. https://t.co/Ss2nBUsUqo I want to thank Rahm Emanuel for not endorsing me. I don’t want the endorsement of a mayor shutting down schools and firing teachers. We do things a little different in this campaign: We bring people TOGETHER. #BernieInIL Watch Bernie live in Summit  IL where he will discuss a wide range of issues including combating climate change. https://t.co/qKsA4whrIh On criminal justice reform and the need to fight racism there is no other candidate who will fight harder. https://t.co/a9MEqCSgcn The failure to prosecute the crooks on Wall Street for their illegal behavior is a clear indictment of our broken criminal justice system. North Carolinians who missed the first deadline can still register for early voting until tomorrow at 1PM ET. https://t.co/Ke8gBZSW9n If elected  I won't send the TPP to Congress and will continue to fight efforts to pass it. I urge @HillaryClinton to join me. Remembering Jane Lang. We will continue her fight for universal health care. https://t.co/X4ydVYWDEA https://t.co/NRMczVYW2E As president  I will govern based on principle not poll numbers. Every day I will fight for the public interest not the corporate interests. I don't give speeches to Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Unlike Sec. Clinton  I have nothing to release. If we are going to rebuild the crumbling middle class we need a stronger trade union movement  not a weaker one. The politics of division has no place in our country. Trump should take responsibility for addressing his supporters' violent actions. I agree. That's why I have a plan that bans fracking and puts a price on methane emissions. https://t.co/W6LgrGn5HY We must move aggressively toward energy efficiency and the development of sustainable energy sources. The recklessness  greed and illegal behavior of Wall Street drove this country into the worst economic downturn in modern history. We are increasingly living in an oligarchy where big money is buying politicians. We must overturn Citizens United before it’s too late. No president will be able to address the problems that we face unless there is a mass movement  a political revolution in this country. It's unacceptable to ask working-class Americans to work until they are 68-70 years old before qualifying for full Social Security benefits. Real change takes place when people stand up and say “enough is enough ” and when we create a political revolution from the ground up. The message we are sending to the billionaire class is you cannot continue to get huge tax breaks while children in America go hungry. PolitiFact: Hillary Clinton wrongly says Bernie Sanders wants to delay the Clean Power Plan https://t.co/w04bNZaLRW I hope one day Republicans can overcome the needs of their campaign contributors and worry instead about the planet they're leaving behind. This campaign is not a billionaire-funded campaign. It is a people’s campaign. We have got to tell corporate America they cannot continue to abandon workers in the U.S. We've lost 60 000 factories since 2001. This is why I am running for President of the United States of America. #DebateWithBernie https://t.co/7oH2ouerx5 Only one candidate has a plan to get to universal health care coverage. How would @HillaryClinton get there? #UnivisionDebate Why does @HillaryClinton think it's okay for Trump's kids to go to elementary  middle  and high schools for free  but not colleges? Bernie voted against the Iraq War and regime change in Libya because he feared what would happen the day after. Unfortunately  he was right. Necesitamos una economía que funcione para todos  no sólo para un puñado de multimillonarios. #UnivisionDebate https://t.co/uanLmkToyX The head of Goldman Sachs didn’t give Bernie $225 000 for a speech. He said Bernie would be dangerous for Wall Street. And he’s right. There is nobody in the United States Congress who has taken on the Koch Brothers more than Bernie Sanders. #UnivisionDebate Video from that Clinton speech telling Wall St to "cut it out" shows her greeting "wonderful donors" in the room. https://t.co/314TkAqqLJ Let's stop the racism. Let's stop the xenophobia. Let's stop Trump. #DemDebate Bernie’s immigration plan is the gold standard. "We hope [Hillary] is inspired to match his boldness.” -@nytimes https://t.co/LwZPIpIJeG "The banks of NY and our other financial institutions are probably the biggest winners." - @HillaryClinton on the "auto" bailout in 2008. .@HillaryClinton doubles down on "negative tactics" and dishonesty described earlier by The New York Times: https://t.co/dfOag8mP01 I will not deport children from the United States of America. I can make that promise.  #DemDebate Bernie’s guiding light on the issue of immigration reform: keeping families together  not dividing them up. https://t.co/ExVZjpyDna "I am  you know  adamantly against illegal immigration.” - @HillaryClinton. https://t.co/XyBZfjGyqP When we began we were 50 points behind the “inevitable Democratic nominee.” Now that inevitable candidate ain't so inevitable. #DemDebate I stand with Chicago teachers. We shouldn't close schools and lay off teachers to reward Wall Street. https://t.co/4EH0myWyzw The pharmaceutical industry has become a health hazard for the American people. We pay the highest prices for prescription drugs. Some people say young people are apathetic. It seems to me like they are ready to transform America. I hope Utah repeals the death penalty. There's enough violence in the world and the  government shouldn't add to it. https://t.co/WzzdLIFgJZ Multinational corporations making billions  moving jobs overseas  are asking for handouts from our middle class? I don't think so. The wealthiest country in history has gotta get its priorities right. That's taking care of its people. Not more tax breaks for the rich. .@FLGovScott  veto this bill. Don’t play politics with abortion.  https://t.co/ufhPOuj8DI Since I have been an elected official  I have used my influence to stand with those who have no power  and to take on the ruling class. What kind of morality is it when Congress gives tax breaks to billionaires but cuts nutrition programs that serve kids? At the end of the day big money doesn’t always win. What we are showing is that millions of people agree with us. Greed is the religion of the billionaire class. A nation based on that kind of greed will not survive morally  economically or politically. The corporate media counted us out. The pollsters said we were way behind. But we won. Thank you  Michigan. https://t.co/Iywg9N3B1z While millions of Americans are just one paycheck away from economic devastation  the wealthy have never had it so good. Michigan: if you’re in line to vote  you have a right to vote. Stay in line and make your voice heard. There is no reason why women should be paid significantly less than men. It’s sexism and it has got to end. https://t.co/L5BOkmpbrB Love always trumps hate. https://t.co/B8R8nyCNNx This is what we can learn from history: when people stand together  there is nothing we cannot accomplish. https://t.co/VmMgZG6sw6 Standing up for our LGBTQ sisters and brothers is the duty of all elected officials. This should make us all proud. https://t.co/r4Rw5xInA8 We must ensure pay equity for women workers. Equal pay for equal work — it's not a radical idea. #InternationalWomensDay Voting for Bernie in Michigan or Mississippi? Use #iVoted and share this image! https://t.co/idCH9q6VOQ We must end the international embarrassment of being the only major country that doesn't guarantee paid leave.  #InternationalWomensDay This is why it's so important that our Democratic debate moderators #AskAboutAbortion.  https://t.co/sCxeoaCllx Ready for a political revolution? Get out and vote! Text VOTE to 82623 for voting information. #GOTVforBernie https://t.co/3akTyct7xL Change cannot take place without political participation. Hillary Clinton on refugee children from Central America in June of 2014: https://t.co/1jRHfvtrgo Hillary Clinton on refugee children from Central America in June of 2014: "They should be sent back." https://t.co/nmDoWgLOUW The decision to have an abortion is a right of any woman  without interference from politicians.  #InternationalWomensDay What this campaign is about is bringing people together. Michigan and Mississippi: please go vote today. https://t.co/pboxzWGLvo We need your help today! When you vote  ask a poll worker for your precinct's turnout number and report it: https://t.co/hhT0CRTzHg. Many people think Congress regulates Wall Street  but in fact it's Wall Street that regulates Congress. Michigan and Mississippi — It's your turn to vote for our political revolution. Grab your friends and family and go out and vote. Americans shouldn't have to live in fear that they'll go bankrupt if they get sick. Health care must be a right  not a privilege. We can't just take incremental steps to combat climate change. We've got to be bold because the future of our planet depends on it. There is so much violence in our world today. I just don't think the state should add to it. That's one reason I oppose the death penalty. I believe firmly that we can accomplish great things in this country if millions of Americans begin to stand up and fight for real change. Our movement is about creating an America that ensures nobody working 40 hours a week has to live in poverty. Bottom line: with ISIS in Libya  the 2011 intervention made us less safe. You don’t get extra points for good intentions. It took @FoxNews to ask the first question about abortion at a Democratic town hall or debate. #DemTownHall In a democratic society  politics should not be treated like a baseball game or a soap opera. We need a serious discussion about the issues. When forced to defend a record of supporting bad trade deals  sometimes you say things that just aren't correct. https://t.co/n6g6RfqUeY Last night  @HillaryClinton went out of her way to mischaracterize my vote on the auto bailout. https://t.co/n6g6Rf9jnq From the @WashingtonPost: "Sanders is actually on the record as supporting the auto bailout. He even voted for it." https://t.co/Lx9iypxFo3 The reality is that Congress doesn’t regulate Wall Street. Wall Street  its lobbyists and their billions of dollars regulate Congress. The system is rigged when the average person works longer hours for lower wages  and 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. Tonight proved once again that we are well on our way towards winning this Democratic primary. Thank you  Maine!  https://t.co/LA5bXw8z95 We all know my opponent has a very large super PAC. We fundraise a different way. Chip in: https://t.co/uaLlTZf4s5 #DemDebate If you care about clean water in Flint  how can you turn around and support fracking? #DemDebate Q. Do you support fracking?  A. No.  #DebateWithBernie As Bernie answers this question from Abigail’s father  consider visiting her GoFundMe page to support her family: https://t.co/xdXMGEsTO4 Boeing is making billions of dollars a year and often pays no income taxes. Why do they need our taxpayer dollars? #DemDebate FACT: Bernie Sanders supported the bailout of the auto industry in 2008. #DemDebate https://t.co/wFltw3Tutf Bernie was one of the first  not one of the last  to oppose the job-killing TPP. #DemDebate cc: @HillaryClinton How do we have so much money to go to war in Iraq but somehow not enough money to provide clean drinking water to Flint? #DemDebate At the end of the day  I will trust the people to create a government that works for them  not Corporate America or Wall Street. #DemDebate We're glad that @HillaryClinton has finally joined us in calling for Gov. Snyder's resignation. #DemDebate Children in America should not be poisoned. The federal government must act. No one should pay a water bill for poisoned water. #DemDebate The governor of Michigan must resign  but more importantly we must take action to help the people of Flint. #DemDebate I've said it since day one: I can't do it alone. Watch the #DemDebate and join the conversation. #DebateWithBernie https://t.co/VZYyLrSIMK A campaign is not about what you said yesterday. It is about what you have stood for your entire career. I helped write the Affordable Care Act. It's done some great things  but we must do more. 50 million are still uninsured or underinsured. We shouldn't be providing corporate welfare to multi-national corporations through the Export-Import Bank. https://t.co/hLcJUJju7n This is a sad day for America. Nancy Reagan had a good heart  and she will be dearly missed. https://t.co/IXbgObtjtd It is time for our country to join every other major industrialized nation and guarantee health care to all as a right  not a privilege. America’s radical transformation from a GM economy to a Wal-Mart economy has decimated the middle class.  https://t.co/yYIRodJVra This campaign is not about me—it's about all of us. No president can accomplish what has to be done unless millions of people come together. We need your help today  Maine! When you caucus  report delegate counts from your location at https://t.co/32SEZ9Nebo. U.S. trade policies proved disastrous for Detroit  Flint: https://t.co/yYIRodJVra Maine: you vote today. The right to vote is at the heart of freedom and equality in America. Make your voice heard. https://t.co/1RBG2NPY93 We’ve got the momentum  the energy and the excitement that will take us all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Thank you for the strong support  Nebraska! https://t.co/CuXeaQ6lSD Thank you  Kansas! When we started this campaign  no one would have ever expected we’d win. #StandTogether https://t.co/dFc67CVmjq I think Governor Snyder should do the right thing and resign. There are no excuses. https://t.co/dWcbeTNIhy It's time for the Walton family to pay their workers a living wage and get off of government welfare. https://t.co/UE3GNqRUdm I think if you're gonna get paid $225k for a speech it must be a good speech—Shakespearian. I can't wait to read it. https://t.co/N86ByFUUZD Vote or caucus for Bernie to say #iCaucused or #iVoted today to keep the White House! #GOTVforBernie https://t.co/QbVh7Figeg ICYMI: Bernie leads Trump at 55 percent to 43 percent and is also leading both Cruz and Rubio by double digits. https://t.co/dXQLv2LycH The right to vote is at the heart of freedom and equality in America  and the effort to suppress it must be met by fierce resistance. We need your help today! When you vote  report delegate counts from your caucuses and turnout from your precincts. https://t.co/hhT0CSbayO A Medicare-for-all plan will save the average middle-class family $5 000 a year.

Go out and vote or caucus: https://t.co/Xne2KWXxso https://t.co/e8a0Z21GCE When we talk about public education  it is not just 1st grade through 12th. We need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. I have opposed disastrous trade agreements which have led to the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs. We will continue to bring people together. We will not allow the Donald Trumps of the world to divide us up. #VoteTogether If the environment were a bank it would have been saved by now. We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Congrats to @Raise_Up_WA for taking the first step to a $15/hr min. wage and paid leave. Today  1 in 3 black males can expect to spend time in prison during their lifetime. This is an unspeakable tragedy. We need real tax reform which demands that the very wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes. What an insult to the thousands of families in Flint who needed help from their government months ago. https://t.co/wbzJBBGGJD Louisiana  Kansas and Nebraska: it's your turn tomorrow! Make your voice heard. https://t.co/ZaoGzRK1GS https://t.co/oKwxm5fZR3 I voted against the USA Patriot Act and will continue to do all that I can to prevent us from moving toward an Orwellian society. Millions of children in this country are not receiving the quality early education that they need. #BernieInIL https://t.co/lWUB2mbafY We judge a country not by the number of millionaires it produces but by how it treats its most vulnerable people. #BernieInIL Everyone over 18 must be registered to vote automatically so that all Americans can make their voices heard. #BernieInIL Universal health care is an idea that has been supported in the US by Democratic presidents going back to FDR and Truman. The United States must join the rest of the industrialized world and provide health care as a right to every man  woman and child. Your work could mean the difference between winning or losing upcoming states for Bernie. https://t.co/aTpBHlAr7O Our campaign is a strong grassroots movement supported by middle-class Americans and working families  not billionaires buying elections. People are becoming involved in this campaign because they want change — real change — and that is what this campaign is about. Outcome in upcoming states depends on how many supporters we identify and turnout with phone calls. https://t.co/IB0L83VHfv #BernieInKS In many states  it's legal to fire someone for being gay or deny someone housing for being transgender. We're gonna change that! #BernieInKS Think big  not small. Ask yourself: do I have to leave college with 30  40 or 50 thousand dollars in debt? #BernieInKS I do not receive millions of dollars from Big Pharma and I do not give speeches for hundreds of thousands of dollars to Wall Street. Brothers  we must stand with our sisters in the fight for pay equity. #BernieInKS https://t.co/6zQ6Prr14b Not many people know it  but Detroit was the richest city in America per capita in 1960. What changed? Bad trade deals killed Michigan jobs. Change happens from the bottom up. Keep fighting  sisters and brothers. #GOPDebate   https://t.co/FDbwLzqXYt You don’t create real public policy unless you listen to the science  and the science is clear: climate change is real. As a society  we should never stigmatize women for breastfeeding in public. https://t.co/I08wzGrdWH In my view  the NSA is out of control and operating in an unconstitutional manner. Politicians who deny climate change is real  despite an overwhelming scientific consensus  are morally bankrupt. #BernieInNE How about we stop spending $80 billion a year locking people up and get corporations out of the business of running jails. #BernieInNE Bernie speaks to the overflow crowd at today's rally in Lincoln  Nebraska. #BernieInNE https://t.co/GvQD08iWkh I know that Sec. Clinton and many of the establishment people think that I am looking and thinking too big. I don’t think so. The people of Detroit know the real cost of Hillary Clinton's free trade policies. https://t.co/OoatUvhEc9 If we are going to win this primary  we have to be ready to fight  organize  and win in the states ahead. Volunteer: https://t.co/IB0L83VHfv Our trade policy must change. Corporations must start investing to create jobs in Michigan and America  not in low-wage countries. How did it happen that 600K manufacturing jobs – jobs that were once a ticket to the middle class – now pay a poverty wage of $9.60 an hour? In 1960  the wealthiest city in America was Detroit. Today  it is the poorest big city. https://t.co/eLPVW4W2mN https://t.co/1a2qtYR1hD We have more billionaires in this country than any other nation. We also have more child poverty than nearly every other major nation. If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today  do you know what he would say about our huge banks? He would say break 'em up. And he would be right. We need banks that invest in the job-creating economy. We don't need more speculation with the American economy hanging in the balance. Looks like Michigan is ready to create a political revolution from the ground up. https://t.co/Kitdqmn8km High-speed Internet access is no longer a luxury. It’s crucial for rural America to be connected and do business with the rest of the world. Today  people living in Bucharest  Romania have access to much faster Internet than most of the US. That’s unacceptable and must change. I don’t believe in the agenda of the billionaire class. And what this campaign is showing is that millions of Americans agree. #FeelTheBern Every man  woman and child in our country should be able to access the health care they need regardless of their income. .@realDonaldTrump and I agree on something. He and I both want to run against the other. Guess who wins? https://t.co/fLuqfJW8PB The outcome in upcoming states will depend on how many Bernie supporters we identify and turnout with phone calls. https://t.co/IB0L83VHfv America’s 20 wealthiest people now own more wealth than the bottom half of the American population combined. #BernieInPortland We have the highest childhood poverty of nearly any major country on earth—you’re damn right I'm gonna talk about poverty. #BernieInPortland We want a nation where young black men and women can live without fear of being falsely arrested  beaten or killed. It’s time for a political revolution that takes on the fossil fuel billionaires and puts people before polluters. https://t.co/DHUPMvf4Ys They have the money  but we have the people.

We've gotta do it together through a strong grassroots movement. #COpolitics https://t.co/mKbg4LKeWP Native Americans know that if you destroy nature you destroy life. That is what we’re doing globally and that has got to change. #copolitics This campaign is about a political revolution — millions of people standing up and saying "enough is enough." This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders  Hillary Clinton  or Donald Trump. This campaign is about you. https://t.co/xH0ajXnb0o America should be known as the country with the best educated population in the world  not the country with the most people in jail! Bernie trumps the GOP. If we want a Democrat in the White House  Bernie is our best chance to beat Republicans. https://t.co/Ziv3wuK2oS America's first black president cannot and will not be succeeded by a hatemonger who refuses to condemn the KKK.

Polls are open from 7am to 7pm. https://t.co/nv1jjkqwgf It's time to ensure that every worker in this country has access to paid family leave  paid sick time and paid vacation leave.

Today  we'll be at Claflin University. Join us! https://t.co/7a3jggABnh I have a 98% pro-union voting record. I believe that the middle class will not grow unless we strengthen the American trade union movement. Since 2001  bad trade policies caused 60 000 factories in America where workers were earning decent wages and decent benefits to close. This great university is being threatened with cuts.

Day 20 since she said "I will look into it." https://t.co/4P9tquPkMz Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages. They're overworked  underpaid  and under enormous stress. All immigrants  including undocumented workers and their families  should be able to get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. What welfare reform did  in my view  was to go after some of the weakest and most vulnerable people in this country. https://t.co/GNKaEQlY7V Let us be clear: the campaign finance system in the U.S. is corrupt  it is undermining democracy and it needs to be fundamentally changed. When a police officer breaks the law - like any other public official - that police officer must be held accountable. Nothing is more important than passing on a Mother Earth that is healthy and habitable for our grandchildren. https://t.co/UA4LZjWw18 I believe that a handful of banks on Wall Street are too big and powerful and need to be broken up. Another candidate does not agree. I do not have a super pac. One candidate has a super pac which receives many millions of dollars from Wall Street. One of us does not. Washington is too busy representing the interests of wealthy campaign contributors to worry about the middle class. https://t.co/87bGhJATUY If we stand together  if we build a political revolution  there is nothing we can't accomplish. https://t.co/drxkkGaxcW We need to invest in jobs and job training  rather than building more and more jails and locking up more and more people. It's unacceptable that billionaire families can leave virtually all of their wealth to their families without paying a reasonable fair tax. Just a reminder. https://t.co/JD2SUPmGZ3 We will take on the drug and insurance industry and make it clear that health care must be a right for ALL. I won't leave 29 million behind. How we will end childhood poverty in America today? By standing together. As one nation. As a united nation. https://t.co/kNWT8xCrHO We judge a country not by the number of billionaires it produces but by how it treats the most vulnerable people.  https://t.co/BgCzIEJbm1 We must pursue policies that transform America into a nation that affirms the value of its people of color. .@HillaryClinton believes Republicans should set the standard for disclosure of her Wall Street speeches. Aren’t we better than that? Taking on the tobacco industry is something I would enjoy doing very  very much. #DemTownHall This campaign is relying on small campaign donors  over 1 000 000 of them  27 bucks a piece. That's who I'm indebted to. Not Wall Street. It is absurd that the top one-tenth of one percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. #DemTownHall "My father is from Poland. No one has asked for my birth certificate. Maybe it has to do with the color of my skin." #DemTownHall Criminal justice reform must be the civil rights issue of the 21st century and the first piece has to be police reform. #DemTownHall This campaign is based upon a very simple principle: Real change never comes from the top on down. It always comes from the bottom up. Our health care plan is the only plan that would provide care for all Americans  regardless of income. https://t.co/BaJYpJGtYe We are accomplishing what the political establishment said was impossible.

It's been 17 days  16 hours and 32 minutes since @HillaryClinton said she would "look into" releasing her paid speeches to Wall Street. This campaign is about bringing people together. We understand that when we stand together  there is nothing we can't accomplish. There would be nothing that would give me greater pleasure than beating @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/4L9HoWrDzl Republicans should worry more about their grandkids and the future of our planet than their campaign contributors. https://t.co/WLUq1HCQrs If you want a candidate who’s going to defeat Donald Trump  you’re looking at him. #SCforBernie https://t.co/Kzh46gKAo3 Our opponents are funding their campaigns with checks from billionaires and Wall Street. Not us. #BernieInSC Here's the reality: the status quo is not enough. We need real change. And we're not gonna get that by tinkering at the margins. #BernieInSC Racism  sexism  and bigotry is not what this country is supposed to be about. #BernieInSC My message to you today is straightforward: If elected president  I will rein in Wall Street so they can’t crash our economy again. We need police forces that reflect the diversity of our communities. Kids are jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. Nothing happens to Wall Street execs whose illegal behavior harmed millions. It is time to take marijuana off the federal list of controlled substances and let states decide. We need to solve problems like immigration in America  not use these issues to promote division and hostility. I want to thank the people of Nevada for the support they have given us and the boost that their support will give us as we go forward. If you're in line to caucus  DO NOT LEAVE! You don't need ID to caucus or to register to vote. Any issues? Call 702-778-4336. Tens of thousands of fellow Bernie supporters are on their way to the caucus. Get to your caucus location now. https://t.co/N9XY2Saox8 Together  we can send a message that will echo from Wall Street to Washington  from Maine to California. Go caucus. #NVforBernie Nevada: today we caucus. Get to your caucus location by 11am. If there is a large voter turnout  we can win. Join history in the making. We can live in a country where every veteran receives the health care and benefits they have earned and receives the respect they deserve. Nevada  please help us move the political revolution forward!  https://t.co/ZKxwLTh5AY This campaign is gaining momentum because we are listening to the pain of the people.

Caucus tomorrow at 11AM. #AmericaTogether https://t.co/zVy1kS9ZAx Welcome to the political revolution. #AmericaTogether It's time to end bigotry and build a nation in which we stand together and condemn the anti-Muslim rhetoric we're hearing. #AmericaTogether أمريكا يصبح  أحسن وطن عندما نحن نقف معاً ونقول لا الى العنصرية والكراهية والتعصب الأعمى  #AmericaTogether https://t.co/evFEIRWTSx जब हम साथ मिलकर जातिवाद  नफरत और कट्टर्ता से इनकार करते हैं  अमेरिका एक बेहतर राष्ट्र बन जाता है। #AmericaTogether America becomes a greater nation when we stand together and say no to racism  hatred  and bigotry. #AmericaTogether https://t.co/Ybz5CTOyXR People of color are incarcerated  policed and sentenced to death at significantly higher rates than their white counterparts. Under my health care plan  people will no longer have to choose between health care and other necessities like food  heat and shelter. I am proud to stand with Culinary 226 in their fight for a better union health care contract! https://t.co/N0mnMRhfXy This is what a paid @BernieSanders speech looks like: https://t.co/g0AaUEu4yn Don't worry.

That’s rationing. Those are wait times.  #DemTownHall 'Socialist' programs from FDR and LBJ: ✅ Social Security ✅ Minimum Wage ✅ Medicare and Medicaid ✅ 40-hour work week #DemTownHall "Today in 2016  in many respects  a college degree is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago." #DemTownHall I've put forward an immigration plan that protects children and keeps families together. It is time for @HillaryClinton to do the same. "It is simply unacceptable that 35 percent of African-American children are living in poverty." #DemTownHall I voted against the war in Iraq. I am vigorously opposed to an endless war in the Middle East. We can live in a country where every citizen has health care as a right  not a privilege. Businesses would save over $9 400 a year in health care costs for the average employee under my Medicare-for-All plan. We need to end prisons for profit  which result in an over-incentive to arrest  jail and detain  in order to keep prison beds full. The political revolution continues in Nevada  but we can’t do it without you. If we show up on caucus day  we can win—it’s that simple. Acclaimed artist and actvist Shepard Fairey has a new design in the Bernie Store: https://t.co/TeOfYwtwWo https://t.co/i9RIoz9AsO We must heed Pope Francis' call to put compassion at the center of our immigration policy.  https://t.co/17jgI5cX00 Today  shamefully  we have more than 12 million Latinos living in poverty in this country. https://t.co/p7N4IGKePd The Red Hot @ChiliPeppers have a message for you... https://t.co/5TSqFrZV9S If there is a high turnout on Saturday  I think we can win. I urge you all: come out with your family and caucus. https://t.co/X3ACxiQQg5 People in American jails are disproportionately people of color. That’s the reality in America today. That’s a reality that has to change. A handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power. In 2008  their illegal behavior nearly destroyed the U.S. and global economy. I believe when we stand together  when we share the vision that government should work for all of us  there is nothing we can't accomplish. This government belongs to all of us  not just a wealthy few. That is what this campaign is about. That is the political revolution. I will lead the effort for comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship. I ask you to join me in this campaign to build a future that works for all of us  and not just the few on top. https://t.co/keIzoR3r5T The decision about abortion is a decision for a woman and her doctor to make  not the government. Over 20 percent of our children are living in poverty -  the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. When voter turnout is high  Democrats and progressives win. When voter turnout is low and people are demoralized  Republicans win. Learn what you need to know to caucus for Bernie in Nevada! Then commit to caucus here: https://t.co/X3ACxiQQg5 https://t.co/HqiVa8n1hQ Real change comes about when large numbers of ordinary Americans get involved in the democratic process. https://t.co/BVY5RGNTat "Enough is enough of our police officers targeting people of color." - South Carolina Rep.

It is beyond my comprehension that in the year 2016  in the United States of America  we are poisoning our children. https://t.co/sB7MvNJZwm American democracy is one person  one vote – with every citizen having an equal say – and no voter suppression. The Constitution is very clear: @POTUS has a duty to nominate SCOTUS justices. Let's have a hearing and a vote. Paid family and medical leave  health care for all - these are ideas that exist in every other major country on earth. Democrats win when the voter turnout is high. When people come together and we reject division. Register to vote: https://t.co/J1Yama6upv I've been criticized for saying this so let me say it again: health care should be a right  not a privilege. https://t.co/egsnV19Is5 I believe what is required in this moment is to think big.

You can have a different point of view on immigration or anything else  but we cannot be attacking people because of their religion. Next time you hear a politician talking about “family values ” ask yourself if they support measures which really help working families. Every year  the federal government makes billions of dollars in profits off of student loans. We must end this most revolting practice! We have the momentum here in Nevada but I need your help. This is it. Sign up for a volunteer shift right now: https://t.co/X3ACxiQQg5 Nearly eight out of ten workers who can take time off under the Family and Medical Leave Act cannot do so because they can’t afford it.

I now believe that we need to break up financial institutions that are too big to fail. Our campaign is funded by the people  others are funded by Wall Street and big money interest. Proud to be on the opposite side of an anti-immigration hate group. https://t.co/qk86jY6poZ America is about standing together as one people  not allowing ourselves to be divided up by religion or nationality. Executives at Exxon pioneered the research on climate change before anyone else did  and lied about it to protect their bottom line. People who graduated in 2014 with student debt owed an average of $30 000 each. That’s unsustainable and unforgivable. We must put an end to discriminatory laws and the purging of minority-community names from voting rolls. As President  I will make public colleges and universities free  and we’re going to pay for it by putting a tax on Wall Street speculation. We must not accept a nation in which billionaires compete as to the size of their super-yachts  while children in America go hungry. This looks to me like a group of people who are prepared to make a political revolution. #BernieInDenver https://t.co/M9nShUL4Nq True freedom does not occur without economic security. #BernieInDenver https://t.co/0YeY9DVetA Higher education is a right. We must fight to ensure that every American can go to college without living in debt.

Volunteer for as many shifts as you can. https://t.co/OtDJlNtrLC The U.S. pays the highest price in the world for prescription drugs; 1 out of 5 patients cannot afford to fill their prescriptions. I don’t believe it is a terribly radical idea to say that someone who works 40 hours a week should not be living in poverty. Under President Obama and Vice President Biden  this country has come a long way economically. https://t.co/yQnZ31pRFf It's unacceptable that millions of college graduates can't afford to buy their first home or car because of outrageously high student debt. The African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.  https://t.co/mhq9j23QtE It's irresponsible that my opponent justifies sending children back to terribly violent countries as a way to "send a message." Raids are not the answer. We cannot continue to employ inhumane tactics involving rounding up and deporting thousands of immigrant families. I've put forward an immigration plan that protects children and keeps families together. It is time for @HillaryClinton to do the same. Sanders Campaign Statement on Clinton’s Immigration Comments https://t.co/QG9cssCcKH We need immigration reforms that make sure corporate America can't exploit vulnerable migrant workers. I am running for president because 11 million undocumented people cannot continue living in the shadows. "I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend  and I will not take advice from him on foreign policy." #DemDebate We need to reduce wasteful spending at the Department of Defense  which is the one major agency that has refused an audit. #DemDebate The decision to have an abortion is a right of any woman without interference from politicians. #DemDebate https://t.co/IT9Uge7xud A people-powered campaign: ✅ 3.7M contributions ✅ More than 1M donors ✅ Average contribution &lt; $30  https://t.co/m6S1VVcZRj #DemDebate About 85 percent of @HillaryClinton's campaign money has come from large donors. #DemDebate Fact check on @HillaryClinton: "They should be sent back…" https://t.co/nmDoWgLOUW It is appalling that @HillaryClinton insisted that minors be shipped back to their country of origin like a package marked return to sender. Bernie’s guiding light on the issue of immigration reform: keeping families together  not dividing them up. #DemDebate 1 in 4 black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during their lifetime. That is an unspeakable tragedy. #DemDebate Young people in this country know exactly what they're doing. They know we need big change  not just small steps. https://t.co/fbeqX8Sedh Only one candidate has laid out exactly how to pay for all of their proposals. Hint: it's on this site: https://t.co/zVtaKCxObf #DemDebate The reality is there is one major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people: the United States. #DemDebate The truth: 29 million Americans have no health insurance  31 million are uninsured. Only one candidate has a plan to change that. #DemDebate We need a political revolution. The same old  same old just isn't going to do it. We have got to be bold. #DemDebate When you tell a woman that she cannot control her own body  that's extremism. Democratic Socialism means democracy. It means creating a government that represents all of us  not just the wealthiest people in America. It makes no sense to me that the United States of America has more jails and prisons than colleges and universities. We are going to get the government out of profiteering on student loans. That is going to change. In the industrialized world  the United States is Number 1 in billionaires and Number 1 in childhood poverty. That's outrageous. No president alone can effectively address the crises facing the working families of this country without a powerful grassroots movement. "We set a goal of raising $6 million today and you already crushed that goal. Let's try $7 million." - Jeff Weaver https://t.co/rLdKJyJo01 I am moved by the fact that our campaign’s financial support comes from more than 3.7 million individual contributions at an average of $27. We need to take bold steps to stop the increased impoverishment of already depressed communities. We need to raise the minimum wage. We can live in a country where all of our qualified young people  regardless of income  can go to college. As a kid I learned what lack of money means to a family  and never liked to see people without a lot of wealth put down or pushed around. As President  let me be very clear that no one will fight harder to end racism and reform our broken criminal justice system than I will. Wall Street may have an endless supply of money  but we have millions of working families standing together demanding real changes. I believe America is ready for a new path to the future. Join our campaign for president at https://t.co/zofUc3X5GB. https://t.co/zVDyjmThjy Last night we served notice to the political and economic establishment of this country.

When we do that we change America. #FITN https://t.co/DqeDxxu1Pd I’m not running for president because it’s my turn  but because it’s everyone's turn to live in a nation of hope and opportunity for all.

Last night  we began the political revolution not just in Iowa  not just in New Hampshire but all over this nation. https://t.co/vvEuSt7uwW We do not represent the interests of the billionaire class  Wall Street or corporate America. We don't want their money. What last night proved is that every single contribution matters and every volunteer shift can swing an election. https://t.co/DeV0NhqruK What we proved last night and what we'll prove again next week is what we have said all along: when we stand together  anything is possible. We accomplished what the political establishment said was impossible. Don't underestimate us https://t.co/DeV0NhI2mi https://t.co/CwH0mhkkT2 Want real change? Caucus tonight for Bernie Sanders.

Come out and caucus. #IowaTODAY https://t.co/heHAfRUMgR This is our country  and it's time we took it back from the billionaire class. Today  we come together to say  "Enough is enough." It is absurd that one family (the Waltons of @Walmart) has more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans. https://t.co/qohh31E5iq We must not accept a nation in which billionaires compete as to the size of their super-yachts  while children in America go hungry. When you go to the hospital  you should not come out in bankruptcy. https://t.co/HDtRTzAWcm Let me say it loudly and clearly: I believe that health care should be a right  not a privilege. https://t.co/fYI1m0v6Rw I worry very much that our nation is sliding into oligarchy. Together  we're gonna stop that. https://t.co/PGmhz9E5GS The revolution starts here. The revolution starts now. https://t.co/9DmWXICxxm Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook just said health care as a right is an idea that "can’t get done in Washington.” Couldn't disagree more. I do not represent corporate America and I don’t want their money. I am proud to tell you that I am the only candidate on the Democratic side that does not have a super PAC. We need to create a culture which cannot just be based on the worship of money. Any Democrat looking for a clear choice in the general election should caucus Monday for Sen. Bernie Sanders. https://t.co/AcJ0KvIR2J The reason we are doing well in this campaign is because we are telling the truth. #CaucusForBernie https://t.co/oFfOubzO7J For the last 40 years the great middle class of this country has been in decline and faith in our political system is now extremely low.

It has been the goal of Democrats since Franklin D. Roosevelt to create a universal health care system guaranteeing health care to everyone. Criminal justice reform must be the civil rights issue of the 21st century and the first piece has to be police reform. Together we are going to create an economy that works for working families  not just the 1 percent. https://t.co/HQ00u518gW American democracy is one person  one vote – with every citizen having an equal say – and no voter suppression. Instead of cutting head start and childcare  we need to move to a universal pre-k system for all the children of this country. To my Republican colleagues I say: worry less about your campaign contributions and worry more about your children. https://t.co/5WVpbl6S2x BREAKING: Sanders super PAC haul    $0.00 Climate change is real  it is caused by human activity and it is creating devastating problems in the United States and around the world. At a time when senior poverty is increasing  we must expand Social Security benefits  not cut them. Three major profitable corporations not only pay nothing in federal income taxes  they actually got a rebate.  https://t.co/QXZN4FddrF A single-payer system already exists in the United States. It's called Medicare and the people enrolled give it high marks. A living wage should not only be fair  it should be equitable. We must pass pay equity for women workers. #EqualPayCantWait If I’m president  will Wall Street like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I’m president? You better believe it. When we began we were 50 pts behind the “inevitable Dem nominee.” Now that inevitable candidate ain’t so inevitable. https://t.co/YLRa7Uru4W Climate change is real  it is caused by human activity  and the United States must lead the world in reversing its effects. I want to end the sad reality of having more people in jail than any other country. I'd rather we have the best educated population. If we stand together  there is no limit to what we can accomplish. We can bring hope to the political process. We can make real change. It is not a radical idea to say that no person in this country working 40 hours a week should live in poverty. We must significantly increase the role that all people play in the political process. Change happens when we stand up and fight back. Mothers should not be afraid of their children being targeted by the police because of the color of their skin. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised to a living wage of $15 an hour. Freedom of speech does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government. https://t.co/ruNqXpijRO When we stand together there is nothing we cannot accomplish.  But when we're divided  the big money interests will always win. Forcing a woman to separate herself from her baby because she is low income or working class is not a family value. From the beginning of this campaign we have called for more debates. @HillaryClinton has not. Why is that? The answer is obvious. The reason we'll win the general election is that we will expose the Republicans for what they are. #iacaucus https://t.co/xqQ3j96Wmz On this Holocaust Remembrance Day  we vow never to forget the lessons of that tragedy and to stand up to all forms of hate. Bernie Sanders: speaking tonight in Mason City  Iowa.   Hillary Clinton: at investment firm fundraiser in Philadelphia. We are the wealthiest nation in the world  but few Americans know that because so much of the new wealth goes to the people on top. Super PACs funded by billionaires buy elections. Ordinary people don’t vote. We have an economic and political crisis in this country. Regardless of their income  we need to give our children a fair shot at attending college -college education tuition should be free for all. Democratic socialism means that we have government policy which does not allow the greed of the fossil fuel industry to destroy our planet. Democratic socialism means that in a democratic  civilized society the wealthiest people and largest corporations must pay their fair taxes. We must protect a woman’s right to choose and we must defend Planned Parenthood. #BernieInMN https://t.co/laFQS1BSmT GOP family values are that our gay brothers and sisters shouldn't be able to get married. I disagree. #BernieInMN https://t.co/1qqJTJOlia Ready for a radical idea? We’re gonna invest in jobs and education  not more jails and incarceration. #BernieInMN https://t.co/qi93U7DiBT ”You don’t have to drag Bernie into the fight  he leads the fight!” - @KeithEllison https://t.co/rgu8K0HCTD We have a moral responsibility to combat climate change and leave this planet healthy and habitable for our kids and grandchildren. We should not be firing teachers  we should be hiring teachers. #BernieInMN https://t.co/zseykBfqqA Brothers  we must stand with our sisters and demand pay equity so women get equal pay for equal work. #BernieInMN https://t.co/3W132q1cgI One of five people in this country that get a prescription from a doctor cannot afford to fill that prescription. That’s wrong. #BernieInMN I believe that we need a political revolution. The same old  same old just isn't going to do it. We have to be bold. #BernieInMN Democratic socialism means that if someone works forty hours a week  that person should not be living in poverty. The fact that on any given night there are fifty thousand homeless veterans on the street is a national disgrace. Experience is important  but so is judgement. #DemTownHall There has been a massive redistribution of wealth. The problem is it has gone in the wrong direction. #DemTownHall https://t.co/5ViCUCST64 Under Bernie's plan  the average family would pay less for an entire year of health care than they currently do in a month. #DemTownHall 'Socialist' programs from FDR and LBJ: ✅ Social Security ✅ Minimum Wage ✅ Medicare and Medicaid ✅ 40-hour work week #DemTownHall Anybody in this country  regardless of their income  should be able to go get a higher education. #DemTownHall I #StandWithPP against those who want to take away a woman's right to an abortion. https://t.co/kHVLln3tfQ Today three out of the four largest banks in this country are larger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail. I support 12 weeks of paid leave for every worker. Say you support paid leave for mothers &amp; fathers too. https://t.co/LUCzLjlR34 I asked if anyone had experienced living on $12k a year on Social Security. This woman's story was heartbreaking. https://t.co/1ZNR8kYCQ1 Pundits say that young people won't come out to participate in the political process. Let's make the pundits eat those words  @IowaStateU. Equal pay for equal work. It’s not a radical idea. We have got to move forward and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act into law. As we look back through history  we know women were at the forefront of every progressive victory in this country. https://t.co/4XPox7HG9V We must invest in jobs and education for our young people  not more jails and incarceration. #iacaucus https://t.co/QvUn81n1zL Republicans: try winning elections based on your ideas and your character  not on the amount of money you can collect from billionaires. Under my administration  Wall Street won’t be able to pick and choose which credit agency will rate their products. If Wall Street does not end their greed  we will end it for them. https://t.co/nWY1bU70yg If we’re going to transform our energy system and move away from fossil fuel we cannot support Keystone. I was out front on that issue. We don't represent billionaires  Wall Street or the big drug companies - we don't want their money and we will succeed without them. "@HillaryClinton says Dems should look at which candidate is most electable. We couldn’t agree more.” - Jeff Weaver https://t.co/kOUVJx4Ycq We win when people come together. We win when we reject division. Democrats win when the voter turnout is high. The most effective way to rapidly create meaningful jobs is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. We are building a movement because this country belongs to all of us - not just a handful of billionaires and wealthy campaign contributors. People are seeing that our campaign has the energy  the excitement and is bringing working-class people into it. https://t.co/VnOvaF0TGI It appears that we have Wall Street a little bit nervous and that is a good thing. https://t.co/pUjSDWWD5E We can be a country where all seniors can live in dignity and security  and not be forced to choose between their medicine and their food. People are saying  "How about creating an economy that works for the middle class and not just the billionaires?" https://t.co/mOD3RHmLuP Right now a billionaire pays the same amount of money into Social Security as someone who makes $118 500 a year. We must lift the cap. There is a continuing struggle for racial justice in America. We can deliver change  but not by tinkering with the system at the margins. This is a campaign of the people  by the people  and for the people. Welcome to the political revolution. #WeAreBernie I will continue to stand up to Big Oil and fight for a new energy system creating millions of new jobs while saving our planet. John got a wage freeze and his CEO got a $12 million bonus. Take a couple minutes and listen to John's story. https://t.co/auazNm64uD Republicans are waging a war against women and  let me be clear  it's not a war that we’re gonna allow them to win. https://t.co/4lT07BxGO6 Today  a college degree is equivalent to a high school degree 50 years ago. Public colleges should be tuition free. https://t.co/IpGrV7X8LA The decision handed down by the Supreme Court 43 years ago in Roe v. Wade guaranteed a woman’s right to choose. Despite major advances in civil and political rights  our country still has a long way to go in addressing the issue of gender inequality. Today  on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade  I will say that no one will be a stronger defender of a woman's right to choose than me. #Roe43 If Democrats want to win the general election  frankly  I think I'm the stronger candidate. https://t.co/4NXht1UASv Instead of building more prisons  we need to be building more meaningful lives where young people can have a future. Raising the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour would give about 50 percent of African-American workers a raise. The Porter Ranch gas leak is a climate disaster and yet another example of the urgent national need to transition away from fossil fuels. We must do all we can to provide all Americans  especially low-income families  affordable access to broadband. #RightToConnect There needs to be a path back from prison  including a restoration of full voting rights. Millions of people are standing up and saying that our country belongs to all of us  not just the 1 percent. #fitn https://t.co/hZcFUha987 Today is the sixth-year anniversary of Citizens United  one of the most disastrous Supreme Court decisions in my lifetime. The U.S. spends more on health care per person than any other advanced nation in the world. https://t.co/aSBcHQFIu3 https://t.co/Y4e2Xpn4gJ This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders  Hillary Clinton  or Donald Trump. This campaign is about you. https://t.co/GnGYyU6rl6 Under my Livable Wage plan full-time minimum wage workers would see their income go up $6 240. It’s time to raise the minimum wage. Corporate greed needs to end; they're taking advantage of the benefits of America  yet refuse to accept their responsibilities as Americans. I oppose the Bakken pipeline. Our job is to break our addiction to fossil fuels  not increase our dependence. https://t.co/Eyfx5ugAtP The debate is over. Sixteen of the last 18 years have been the hottest ever recorded. This planet is in trouble. https://t.co/OLsFXu658P Making public colleges and universities tuition free would save middle-class families sending kids to college $9 400 a year on average. It's wrong when over the last 30 years trillions of dollars have been transferred from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent. In a democratic society  politics should not be treated like a baseball game or a soap opera. We need discussion about serious issues. Volunteers like Braden Joplin are the heart and soul of the democratic process. Our thoughts are with his family. https://t.co/FYyNrSJzwa I am asking people not just for your vote  but to be part of a revolution to transform our country. #iacaucus https://t.co/rftqggElLi Now is NOT the time for thinking small or the same-old  same-old establishment politics and stale inside-the-beltway ideas.

This is a people’s campaign. #FeelTheBern Bernie's plan to take on Wall St.: ✅Break up the big banks ✅Reestablish Glass-Steagall ✅Make them pay their fair share #DebateWithBernie Looking forward to your plan  @HillaryClinton. #DemDebate https://t.co/tzjrbEsAaJ Under Bernie's plan  the average family would pay less for an entire year of health care than they currently do in a month. #DemDebate Bernie's plan will expand on the ACA and create a system that puts people's health over profits. https://t.co/Pla3aKWkxQ #DemDebate Addiction is a disease  not a criminal activity. #DemDebate Whenever anyone is killed in police custody it should automatically trigger a federal investigation. #DemDebate Polls confirm: Bernie is the best Democratic candidate to take on Republicans in the general election. #DemDebate https://t.co/ni6T1PsnPT In 1988  Bernie stood up to the gun lobby and said we should not be selling military assault weapons. #DemDebate https://t.co/A9P3KYltok Our campaign is about thinking big: health care for all  $15 minimum wage and creating millions of new jobs. #DebateWithBernie This campaign is about a political revolution to transform our country economically  socially and environmentally. #DebateWithBernie Ready to #DebateWithBernie? Show your support for Bernie at tonight’s #DemDebate: https://t.co/26Imk208Rz https://t.co/jrlgi3ZNiI We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. #FightFor15 https://t.co/BKYJ1uc2RJ A family making $50 000 would save $5 807 a year under my #MedicareForAll plan. https://t.co/Pla3aKWkxQ https://t.co/q7Aa9bpEJ0 It’s time to join every other major nation and guarantee health care to all as a right  not a privilege. https://t.co/Pla3aLdVpo When you’re sick you should go to the doctor. And when you come out of the hospital you should not come out in bankruptcy. #MedicareForAll We're reminded when we knock doors in the snow that our environment is worth fighting for. #FITN https://t.co/zB1LeCkaER Happening now. Bernie  Senator Turner  Killer Mike and Dr. Cornel West LIVE: https://t.co/ofIKpmqeee https://t.co/2JQqr8EiPh We have more people in jail than any other country on earth including China  an authoritarian country 4 times our size. We are going to create a nation that works for all of us  not just for a handful of millionaires and billionaires. https://t.co/mjhjkBc02N When it comes to our responsibilities as human beings and parents  it is imperative our planet stays habitable for our kids and grandkids. We can live in a country where every person who dreams of becoming a citizen has a rational path forward  not just a dark corner to hide in. The greed of the pharmaceutical industry is killing Americans. That cannot continue. Congrats  @POTUS. The test of a great nation is how we use our strength to resolve conflicts in a peaceful way. https://t.co/U1yJvGLAld Not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for the near collapse of our economy. That will change under my administration. I will fight for a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate commercial banking  investment banking  and insurance services. Sanders Statement: Michigan Governor Must Resign over Flint Lead-Poisoning Crisis https://t.co/6hDPRg5iWw Kids are jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. Nothing happens to Wall Street execs whose illegal behavior harmed millions. The reality is that Congress doesn’t regulate Wall Street. Wall Street  its lobbyists and their billions of dollars regulate Congress. During the first 100 days of my administration  the Treasury Department will create a too-big-to fail list of banks and insurance companies. Under my administration  Goldman Sachs execs and other Wall Street CEOs won’t go through the revolving door from Wall Street to government. The $5 billion settlement with Goldman Sachs should make it clear to everyone that the business model on Wall Street is fraud. I applaud the president for stopping all new federal coal leases on public lands. We must do all we can to keep fossil fuels in the ground. We will no longer tolerate an economic and political system that has been rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans. Greed  fraud  dishonesty  and arrogance are the words that best describe the reality of Wall Street today. It is insane and counter-productive that that millions of kids leave school with a mountain of debt that burdens them for decades. Republicans on stage claim Social Security is going broke. They are dead wrong. #GOPDebate Now is not the time for demagoguery and fear mongering. During these difficult times  we will not succumb to Islamophobia. #GOPDebate The Republicans seem to think they could beat our campaign. They haven’t seen the polls. #GOPDebate https://t.co/XitW9T28Vq .@marcorubio: I'm proud that we have a president that is committed to funding Planned Parenthood. #GOPDebate I have a message for Donald Trump: No  we’re not going to hate Latinos or Muslims. We are going to stand together. #GOPDebate We need to make it easier for kids to go to college regardless of their family's income. #BernieInHanover https://t.co/8HACvqnkp1 I want to thank everyone who came out to our town hall tonight and I want to thank all those in the overflow room: https://t.co/Sm28CYDWOk I hope every man in this room will stand up and fight for women's pay equity. https://t.co/Q7k0k441RL The system is rigged when the average person works longer hours for lower wages  and 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. The decision about abortion must remain a decision for the woman  her family and physician to make  not the government. We can live in a nation where everyone  no matter their race  religion or sexual orientation realizes the full promise of equality. In 2015  a college degree is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50 years ago. Public colleges should be tuition free. Will Wall Street like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I'm president? You better believe it. https://t.co/eksfOSKyZo Are we prepared to take on the enormous power of the billionaire class  or do we continue to slide into economic and political oligarchy? "Food stamp recipients didn't cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.” - @POTUS Flashback: Hillary Clinton on universal health care in 2008 https://t.co/QCUnlrNCLe "To Bernie Sanders with thanks for your commitment to real health care access for all Americans..."-@HillaryClinton https://t.co/XMVPEx8fT8 The right-wing in this country is waging a war against women and by working together  we will ensure that is a war they are going to lose. Incredibly  today in many states  it is still legal to fire someone for being gay. That is unacceptable and must change. Tonight’s speech was important. The president reminded us not to be afraid of change  but to wield it to improve the lives of all Americans. We must prevent employers from discriminating against applicants based on criminal history by “banning the box.” We must make high-quality childcare and Pre-K available to every American  regardless of income. When it comes to the rights of women  we cannot go backwards. We have got to go forward. #Bernie2016 We need to ban prisons for profit  which result in an over-incentive to arrest  jail and detain in order to keep prison beds full. Healthcare must be recognized as a right  not a privilege. Proud to have the millions of @MoveOn members join our people-powered campaign. Welcome to the political revolution. https://t.co/t52wjQ5eH4 ICYMI — Joe Biden on our campaign: https://t.co/fAG0LeYmQ7 There needs to be a path back from prison. We need real education and real skills training for the incarcerated. We have got to demilitarize our local police departments so they do not look like invading armies. #DemForum Any serious criminal justice reform must include removing marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act. #DemForum There's a disparity in education for children in poor communities and communities of color in particular. We’ve gotta change that. #DemForum If I am elected President  the billionaire class will know that the days in which they have it all is over. When somebody is forced to flee their country because they are unsafe back home  we have the moral responsibility to protect them. If voter turn out is low  if people give up on political process frankly it will be hard to bring about the changes I want to see. If you ever want to work for a campaign that shares your values on health care  there's always room at Bernie 2016. https://t.co/sFhjtVhepF We must tell the billionaire class: You can't continue to get tax breaks while children in this country go hungry! https://t.co/35EWlahg7y A campaign is not about political gossip. It's about you  the lives of your children and your parents. #BernieInIA https://t.co/6i6diKaMBp Wal-mart benefits and wages are so low  that many of their workers are on Medicaid  food stamps and in subsidized housing. #BernieInIA It is grotesque  immoral  and unsustainable the kind of income inequality that exists today. We must provide legal protections for our undocumented brothers and sisters and we must provide a path towards citizenship. I say to the Walton family: Get off of welfare. Start paying your employees a living wage! https://t.co/PJJrNFqY2m We must also cap ATM fees at $2.00. People should not have to pay a 10 percent fee for withdrawing $40 of their own money out of an ATM. It is unacceptable that millions of Americans are paying credit card interest rates of 20 or 30 percent. If you don't want some right-wing extremist in the White House  you're looking at the candidate who can beat them. https://t.co/GvyB6D2MkG Next time you hear a politician talking about “family values ” you may want to ask whether they support measures which really help families. The test of a great nation is not how many wars it can engage in  but how it can resolve international conflicts in a peaceful manner. With your help  we are poised to pull off one of the great political upsets in the history of our country.  https://t.co/DeV0NhI2mi We will win in 2016. Not just the White House and the Congress  but Statehouses all across the country. #iacaucus https://t.co/DuA7VnVTR0 This campaign is not about electing Bernie Sanders for president. It is about creating a grassroots political movement. It’s about you. Maybe Hillary Clinton should apologize for this? https://t.co/We14Q7Ia5g We have more people in jail than any other country on earth  including China  an authoritarian country four times our size. #iacaucus Here’s my pledge: no fossil fuel lobbyist or executive will find work in a Sanders administration. What's fair is fair. All three of the Democratic candidates for president should be on the debate stage. Period. Just like Social Security  paid family and medical leave is a program that workers would pay into. Just $1.61 a week for the average worker. Over 20 percent of mothers who have jobs in America have to go back to work just two weeks after giving birth. That’s unacceptable. In my view  every worker in America should be guaranteed at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. The environment is not for corporations to exploit today  but a treasure to preserve for future generations to enjoy. Finally @realDonaldTrump and I agree on something. He and I both want to run against the other. Guess who wins? https://t.co/6yRU7pDD1U What I’ve been saying loudly and clearly is: We’ve gotta invest in more jobs and education  not jails and incarceration. Billionaires already own much of our economy. Now  they want to own the United States government as well. https://t.co/OWPQxmMZRt In my view  it is unacceptable that Americans are paying a $4 or $5 fee each time they go to the ATM. People who graduated in 2014 with student debt owed an average of $30 000 each. That’s unsustainable and unforgivable. It is not acceptable that so many young people have criminal records for smoking marijuana  while the CEOs of banks do not. It makes no sense to give tax breaks to billionaires when we have so many children living in poverty. We need to take a hard look at the use of force. Lethal force should be the last resort  not the first resort. No president alone can effectively address the issues facing this country without a political revolution. https://t.co/m6IpuV7APQ It’s not a radical idea to say that someone working 40 hours a week should not be living in poverty. #NVDemsCaucus https://t.co/VnqFA3uavw We need to keep fossil fuels in the ground  and move to 100 percent renewable energy - and we need to act immediately. Mom is working  dad is working  teenagers are working longer hours for lower wages. Yet new wealth goes to top 1 percent. #BernieInVegas We must convince students that if they participate in the political process we can lower the outrageously high student debt they face. It is absurd that college graduates today are carrying debts of $50 000  $100 000 or more. We must deal with the issue of student debt. Republicans hate the government--unless you’re a woman. Then they love the government dictating what you can do with your own body. Trickle-down economics is a fraudulent theory. I believe in creating jobs and raising the wages of working people. https://t.co/aaZEUHe65p No one should be allowed to profit from putting more people behind bars. We must end the private-for-profit prison racket in America! Republicans are waging a war against women and  let me be very clear  it is not a war that we are going to allow them to win. The Koch brothers will spend more money in this election cycle than either the Democratic or Republican parties. This is not democracy. Student debt has surpassed credit card debt and is now the second-largest source of personal indebtedness. It doesn’t have to be this way. When you’re sick  you should be able to access health care. When you go to the hospital  you should not come out in bankruptcy. Everyone over 18 must be registered to vote automatically so that all Americans can make their voices heard. There needs to be a path back from prison. We need real education and real skills training for the incarcerated. Will Wall Street like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I’m president? You better believe it. #BreakEmUp I find it strange that the kid who smokes marijuana gets arrested but the crooks on Wall Street get off scot free. #BreakEmUp I support President Obama's executive actions to make our communities safer. https://t.co/bKVHdsIkfS If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today  he would say to the big banks: break 'em up. And he would be right. #BreakEmUp We have got to demilitarize our local police departments so they do not look like invading armies. We have to end the international embarrassment of not guaranteeing 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. https://t.co/eRUiaAlHYh Any Supreme Court nominee of mine will make overturning Citizens United one of their first decisions. #nhpolitics https://t.co/aJu2DWFrCw I met a man who's been paying off his student loans for 25 years and he's worried about his social security being garnished when he retires. Q. Have you seen @TheBigShort? A. Damn right I have. https://t.co/zkurbatHQ9 A people-powered campaign: ✅$73 million since April 30 ✅2 513 665 contributions ✅More than 1 million donors ✅Average contribution &lt;$30 Elections should be determined by the power of good ideas  not who can hustle the most money from the rich and powerful. As a nation we need to give single moms the support they need. Too many Americans have seen their lives destroyed because they have criminal records as a result of marijuana use. https://t.co/o9a8NcphZr We judge a country not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it produces but by how it treats the most vulnerable people. #fitn Q. Why is my husband's medication $1000 here versus $56 in Canada? A: Last year big pharma employed 1400+ lobbyists. https://t.co/LrmZY54BkA One reason our campaign is doing well is that we are talking to the American people with intelligence. #nhpolitics https://t.co/fpSMcWyQny We have more prisoners  more homeless people  and more economic inequality. It doesn’t have to be this way. We can make better choices. Every veteran who defends this nation must get the benefits they have earned and receive the respect they deserve. https://t.co/yiWOhVLl7S We will not accept a political system which is increasingly corrupt and which allows billionaires to buy elections. Let me be clear: We don't have a super PAC. We don't want a super PAC. And we don't NEED a super PAC. This is a people’s campaign. Republican family values are that a woman should not have the right to control her own body. I disagree. #BernieInMA I do not represent the billionaire class. I don't represent corporate America. They can keep their money. This is our movement. #BernieInMa A people-powered campaign: ✅$73 million since April 30 ✅2 513 665 contributions ✅More than 1 million donors ✅Average contribution &lt;$30 The cost of war is real. It is terrible. And it should be the last resort. It is beyond my comprehension how we can have a major party who deny the reality of what the entire world's scientific community is saying. The gap between the very rich and everyone else in America is wider today than at any time since the 1920s. Let's better understand social and economic justice  tolerance   respect for all people and the environment. https://t.co/nZwvp1cIcE Let's make 2016 a year that people for hundreds of years will remember as the year we transformed America. https://t.co/V9zvJwCv55 I voted against the USA Patriot Act and will continue to do all that I can to prevent us from moving toward and Orwellian society. As 2015 comes to an end  my family  staff and I want to take an opportunity to wish our friends a #HappyNewYear. Many young people are leaving school deeply in debt for what? For the crime of trying to get an education and make it to the middle class. Addiction is a disease  not a criminal activity. I'm proud of this decision. Transgender veterans should never be turned away from the VA. https://t.co/aMNPq2YD4O Republicans think the cost-of-living adjustments that seniors have been receiving are too generous. Last adjustment? Zero. Too generous. We have seen far too many people  often African Americans  who are unarmed  shot and killed by police officers. We must not only make public colleges and universities tuition free  we must also substantially lower interest rates on college debt. The United States government should not be accumulating phone records on tens of millions of Americans. That is not what freedom is about. A wealthy woman who is 50 years old  can expect to live to the age of 92.  A low-income woman can only expect to live until the age of 78. It’s unacceptable that the top 10% of farms collect 75% of farm subsidies  while the bottom 62% don’t receive any. https://t.co/zeLaMtzXRe While we have massive cost overruns with defense contractors  we've got military families on food stamps. Maybe we want to change that. If you want to know how the billionaire class has rigged the economy  read this: https://t.co/d6S2fm3HtZ To those who want to divide us up: No  we’re not going to hate Latinos. We’re not going to hate Muslims. We are going to stand TOGETHER. One in five Americans today cannot afford to fill the prescriptions their doctors write for them. That’s totally crazy. I believe strongly we can protect our people without undermining our constitutional rights. I worry we're moving to an Orwellian society. I do not represent the interests of the billionaire class or corporate America. I represent you. #BernieInVegas https://t.co/vlE0aXfMH9 The fact that on any given night there are fifty thousand homeless veterans on the street is a national disgrace. https://t.co/0Qiee5hfb5 We win when people come together. We win when we reject division  It is a national disgrace that the United States is the only major country that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right. The truth is  the insurance companies and the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress. When Republicans talk about family values  they're talking about defunding Planned Parenthood. #BernieInReno Next year  four of the 12 presidents at the regional Federal Reserve Banks will be former executives from one firm: Goldman Sachs. "Government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob.”  - Franklin D. Roosevelt Getting nervous that working families are catching on to whose interests he truly represents https://t.co/FtnFSHfxOV https://t.co/lddnMEp9Ts I'm running for president because a handful of billionaires and wealthy families are trying to buy elections just to make themselves richer. It is my very strong inclination that if Sandra Bland was a white middle-class woman that would not have happened. https://t.co/HvidGQH8XQ What the polls are showing is the American people are responding to our message and we are on a path to victory. https://t.co/jNpANMhhOK Criminal justice reform must be the civil rights issue of the 21st century and the first piece has to be police reform. Today  29 million of our sisters and brothers are without health care. We can and must do better. I'm running for president because it is harder than ever for students to pay for college and for working parents to afford daycare. I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq. It's time to end religious bigotry and build a nation in which we all stand together and condemn the anti-Muslim rhetoric we're hearing. Every man  woman and child in our country should be able to access quality care regardless of their income. In my view  some of the real heroines in our country today are single moms. Our nation has always been a beacon of hope  a refuge for the oppressed. Merry Christmas! https://t.co/aHbzO1VkJA I'm running for president because the middle class is disappearing and more than half of new income is going to the top 1 percent. The health insurance lobbyists and big pharmaceutical companies try to make "national health care" sound scary. It is not. Very disturbed by reports that the government may commence raids to deport families who've fled here to escape violence in Central America. When they divide us up  they win. When we stand together as one people  we win. We should not be firing teachers  we should be hiring teachers. School teachers and educators are real American heroes. Don't know how to break this to you  but Trump has discovered that women go to the bathroom. And it's upsetting him. https://t.co/ZNwtHJEpUz You want to keep the minimum wage low  and give tax breaks to millionaires. @realDonaldTrump  that is not what makes America great. Corporate America and Wall Street: you can hate me all you want  but we’re going to end your greed. We need to end mandatory minimum sentencing and give judges the discretion to better tailor sentences to the specific facts of a given case. We cannot jail our way out of health problems like drug addiction or social and economic problems like poverty. https://t.co/HCoDXYfqh3 We have to ask ourselves  “Is it morally acceptable  is it economically sustainable  that so few have so much while so many have so little?” This election is not just about electing a President. Far more significantly  it is about transforming America. We need to tell the drug companies to stop ripping off the American people. There is nothing that is more important than passing on a Mother Earth that is healthy and habitable for our kids and grandchildren. The debate is over. Climate change is real and caused by human activity. It's already causing devastating problems around the world. We're going to move to public funding of elections so candidates don't have to beg the wealthy and powerful for money when they want to run. You have a right to health care regardless of whether you are rich or poor. #IACaucus https://t.co/4uef82j2Tb The Koch brothers are prepared to spend $889 million this election to end Social Security and dismantle our safety net. We can't let them. Congress bailed out Wall St. because it was too big to fail. In my view  if a bank is too big to fail  it's too big to exist. Break 'em up. We're gonna have some fun  we're gonna make a political revolution  we're gonna transform America. Other than that  not much. #FeelTheBern I believe that we need a political revolution. The same old  same old just isn't going to do it. We have to be bold. https://t.co/B0SIOR9lSw You are looking at one candidate for president who does not have a super PAC and I’m damn proud of that. Statement on grand jury decision in Sandra Bland case: https://t.co/r1oFu9MHWc Despite growing poverty among seniors  Republicans want more austerity for the elderly and more tax breaks for the rich. If we're going to stand up to the greed of the billionaire class and the greed of corporate America  I accept Wall Street not liking me. We have a broken immigration system that divides families and keeps millions of hard-working people in the shadows. The time is now for the United States to end capital punishment. Voter ID laws aren't intended to discourage fraud  they are intended to discourage voting. And they’ve worked. If we are to retain the fundamentals of American democracy  we need to overturn the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision. We must convince students that if they participate in the political process we can lower the outrageously high student debt they face. Let’s be clear: in terms of protecting the needs of our families the United States lags behind virtually every major country on earth. The fossil fuel industry is destroying the planet with impunity and getting rich while doing it. I support 12 weeks of paid leave for every worker. Say you support paid leave for mothers &amp; fathers too.  https://t.co/gtK8RUMJZf We now have the highest incarceration rate in the entire world with over 2 million in prison and millions more on probation or parole. Post-debate breakfast from this morning at IHOP in Bedford  New Hampshire. #fitn https://t.co/ei21zp0NBM Corporate greed is rampant  and the very rich keep growing richer while everyone else grows poorer. The United States once led the world in terms of the percentage of our young people who had college degrees. Today we’re now in 12th place. I got into politics not to figure out how to become President. I got into politics because I give a damn. #DemDebate https://t.co/7yFxGXyKB7 Addiction is a disease  not a criminal activity.  #DemDebate https://t.co/HdoBtSHq1t Addiction is ravaging families and communities in NH. This is a crisis  and we need to treat it as a health issue—not throw people in jail. Michael Brown  Eric Garner  Jessica Hernandez  Freddie Gray  Sandra Bland  Tamir Rice  Samuel Dubose  Rekia Boyd and too many more. Any serious criminal justice reform must include removing marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act. #DemDebate We need to rethink the "War on Drugs" and treat substance abuse as a serious health issue  not a criminal issue. #DebateWithBernie 'Socialist' programs from FDR and LBJ: ✅Social Security ✅Minimum Wage ✅Medicare and Medicaid ✅40-hour work week #DemDebate When a husband can’t get time off to care for his cancer-stricken wife  that is not a family value. #DemDebate https://t.co/fhao0WkwN8 Medicare for All would eliminate payments to insurance companies that put profits before people. #DebateWithBernie Bernie’s college plan is the only plan that affords lower-income kids the same opportunity for a quality education. #DebateWithBernie CEO's of large multinationals may like @HillaryClinton  but they ain't gonna like me. #DemDebate https://t.co/dPIBsCXH9J We need debt-free college and free tuition is the best way to get there. #DebateWithBernie I don’t think it’s a radical idea that in the richest country in the history of the world health care should be a right  not a privilege. Bernie helped lead the effort against @billclinton who thought it would be a great idea to deregulate Wall Street. #DebateWithBernie "The greed of the billionaire class  the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy.”#DebateWithBernie We do not have a super PAC. We do not want the money of corporate America. This is a people’s campaign. #DebateWithBernie You can’t take on Wall Street banks and billionaires by taking their money. #DebateWithBernie A $1 trillion investment in infrastructure could create 13 million decent paying jobs. Invest in infrastructure  not more war. #DemDebate Equal pay for equal work. It’s not a radical idea. #DebateWithBernie "I worry that @HillaryClinton is too much into regime change and too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be." Bernie supports a defense budget that secures our national security interests not the profits of defense contractors. #DemDebate "I listened to what Bush and Cheney had to say about Iraq. I listened carefully  and I didn't believe them so I voted against the war." Qatar will spend $200 billion on the 2022 World Cup – $200 billion a soccer event  yet very little to fight against ISIS. #DemDebate "I voted against the war in Iraq. That was the right vote. We must be vigorous in combatting terrorism  but we can’t do it alone." We will not turn our backs on the refugees who are fleeing Syria and Afghanistan. #DemDebate “Trump thinks lower wages are a good idea. I believe we must stand together. We can not be divided by race or religion.” #DebateWithBernie Bernie Sanders' gun record (1994) https://t.co/mr699UFYM6 It's time to strengthen gun safety laws: ✅Universal background checks ✅Assault weapon ban ✅Stricter gun trafficking laws #DebateWithBernie There’s only one candidate on stage who voted against (and led the opposition to) the Iraq War. #DebateWithBernie Let’s talk about data that matters to working families: ✅47 million are living in poverty ✅51% of African-American youth are unemployed I am running for president because it is too late for establishment politics and economics. #DebateWithBernie Change never takes place from the top down.

It's about the needs of the American people &amp; the ideas to address those needs. We can deliver change  but we can’t do it by tinkering with the system at the margins.

The U.S. Postal Service is one of our most popular and important government agencies. Let’s protect the Postal Service  not dismantle it. Meanwhile  as tens of millions of Americans struggle to survive economically  the wealthiest people are doing phenomenally well. Clearly  if we are going to save the middle class and protect our planet  we need to change the political dynamics of the nation. A nation will not survive morally or economically when so few have so much  while so many have so little. We can live in a country where all of our qualified young people  regardless of income  can go to college. #Bernie2016 This country faces more serious problems today than at any time in modern history  and establishment politics will not resolve them. This campaign is making a little bit of history. I hope very much that you will become part of our team. https://t.co/6UFBFSG2o9 I’m proud to have Democracy for America and its one-million members join our people powered campaign. I stand with United flight attendants as 24 000 demonstrate at every airport for a fair contract. https://t.co/a6VGcndlik Since the Wall Street crash of 2008  more than 58% of all new income has gone to the top 1%. America needs a political revolution. Over two million contributions have been made to the only campaign that rejects a corrupt campaign finance system. https://t.co/avmYgOKaQz We must end the scandal in which millions of American employees work 50 or 60 hours a week and earn no overtime. The skyrocketing level of income and wealth inequality is not only grotesque and immoral  it is economically unsustainable. Sheldon Adelson is spending unbelievable sums of money  not just on elections  but for control of our media too. https://t.co/nOLlK3pcPY The Fed should act with the same sense of urgency to rebuild the disappearing middle class as it did to bail out Wall Street banks. Thank you to all of the volunteers who filed today to get me on the ballot in Ohio. #OhioForBernie https://t.co/DyiKk8FVSV I am calling on all of us in public life  including my fellow candidates for president  and all Americans to condemn anti-Muslim hatred. If we stand for anything  we have got to stand together to end all forms of racism. https://t.co/lwjisIOY91 I voted against the war in Iraq  and that was the right vote. We must be vigorous in combatting terrorism  but we can’t do it alone. If you're doing everything right but find it harder and harder to get by  you're not alone. https://t.co/NEd8nfDAqb Children should not go hungry in this country while profitable corporations and the wealthy avoid their tax responsibilities. It is long overdue to pass expanded background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. Let us not forget: This country belongs to all of us  not just a handful of billionaires. Fifth #GOPDebate is over. Like the first  not one word about income inequality  climate change  or racial justice. The Rs are out of touch. Still waiting  waiting  waiting. #GOPDebate  https://t.co/O69YXMRQvW Hit mute on the #GOPDebate and check out our plan to fix a broken immigration system: https://t.co/WERAovOEyc Let’s stop the racism. Let’s stop the xenophobia. Let's stop Trump: https://t.co/9e8QYbqgdm What’s reckless is turning our backs on the refugees who are fleeing Syria and Afghanistan. #GOPDebate A lot of talk about war. No talk about the 500 000 men and women who came home with PTSD  and traumatic brain injury. #GOPDebate We will not destroy ISIS by undermining our civil liberties and religious freedoms. #GOPDebate Repeat after me: We must combat anti-Muslim bigotry and all forms of discrimination in our country and in our world. #GOPDebate Greed is destroying our economy. What we need to do is create an economy that works for all of us. It is absurd that the top one-tenth of one percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. We have a moral responsibility to make certain that no American goes hungry or sleeps on the street. It is absurd that one family (the Waltons of @Walmart) has more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans. We need a political revolution that takes back our democracy from establishment politicians and the billionaire class. Join me for a #UnidosConBernie tele-town hall with @georgelopez this Thursday. RSVP here: https://t.co/WyIeEnbhcN https://t.co/BVtafCQ2gb When people get out of jail  it is not easy for them to find a job. It is not easy to return to civil society. Lives are being destroyed. My plan: ✅Make Wall St pay their share ✅Living wages for working people ✅Equal pay for women https://t.co/kiaGSZX6Wr https://t.co/ij5tH6x6eU Most new wealth flows to the top 1 percent. It's a system held in place by corrupt politics. https://t.co/dRPaWTBriU We must demilitarize our police forces so they don’t look and act like invading armies. Today  no piece of legislation gets onto the floor of the US Senate unless it was bought and paid for. https://t.co/YkbZfoGhvZ We need a societal transformation to make it clear that black lives matter and racism will not be accepted in a civilized country. In my view  we need to invest in jobs and education  not jails and incarceration. What's radical about saying we want all our kids regardless of income to get free college? #NHPolitics https://t.co/DBDkS0OQEp We need to stop using prisons as a response to poverty. Change never takes place from the top down. It always takes place from the bottom up. #fitn https://t.co/RfrLZX3mpD It's grossly unfair that young people who worked hard can't afford to go to college. #nhpolitics https://t.co/dV0PYZnQLy There is no rational reason why women should be earning 78 cents on the dollar compared to men who perform the same work. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is totally inadequate. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. The Koch brothers are prepared to spend $889 million this election to end Social Security and dismantle our safety net. We can't let them. The Koch brothers will spend more money in this election cycle than either the Democratic or Republican parties. This is not democracy. Today  over 88% of African-American workers don’t have paid family and medical leave. My plan guarantees 12 weeks of paid leave for all. Veterans put their lives on the line to defend their country. We have a moral responsibility to help them get the best healthcare. Providing a path for kids to go to the University of Iowa is a hell of a lot cheaper than providing them a path to go to jail. #iacaucus Billionaires already own much of our economy. Now  they want to own the United States government as well. #iacaucus https://t.co/LBhRS9t5A0 If men were giving birth to babies  there would not be a lot of discussion regarding the right to choose. https://t.co/MDQyvnzbhs This campaign is sending a message to the billionaire class: you can’t have it all! https://t.co/KfH3Aqr05y Thank you to the volunteers who braved the rain to knock on doors and talk to voters in Austin. #TexasForBernie https://t.co/N1KvxXqrQw The middle class is shrinking while at the same time the people on top are doing phenomenally well. Time for real change. Equal pay for equal work. It’s not a radical idea. If you’re interested in more than just electing a president  we need your help. https://t.co/DeV0NhI2mi https://t.co/Hph17vdGi0 Tell the corporate media to start covering our campaign: https://t.co/qfDH0adU29 https://t.co/hriw3SGvSp In the year 2015  we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago. The reason why the American people are angry is that the government is not addressing the real problems that are impacting them every day. ABC News spent 81 minutes on Donald Trump and only 20 seconds on our campaign. You read that right. Seconds. https://t.co/7kiflEIUj8 I got into politics not to figure out how to become President. I got into politics because I give a damn. Equal pay for equal work. It’s not a radical idea. https://t.co/zbS0t2lgD5 I promise at the end of my first term we won't have more people in jail than in any other country. It’s time for a single-payer health care system in America. #Bernie2016 https://t.co/eO22GbPi6C I don’t think it’s a radical idea that in the richest country in the history of the world health care should be a right  not a privilege. The decision about abortion must remain a decision for the woman  her family and physician to make  not the government. Watch our new TV AD: "Effective" https://t.co/1Q236rRzTL Watch our new TV AD: "Rock" https://t.co/eluHQ7hZRl I want kids whose parents don't— like my parents didn’t — have a lot of money to in fact be able to get a college education tuition free. We need  very clearly  major  major reform in a broken criminal justice system. From top to bottom. When we talk about war  we must talk about the 500 000 men and women who came home with PTSD  and traumatic brain injury. I believe that we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage of 15 bucks an hour. And I apologize to nobody for that. We bailed out Wall Street. It's their time to bail out the middle class and help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free. It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids. In the last 30 years  there has been a massive redistribution of wealth. The problem is this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction. The fact of the matter is that Social Security hasn’t contributed a single nickel to the deficit.  Not a nickel. Here's my promise: Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet. Billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers. That makes no sense at all. We need real tax reform. This campaign is relying on small campaign donors  800 000 of them  30 bucks a piece. That's who I'm indebted to. Not Wall Street. I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money. I will break up these big banks. It’s fun for the media to treat Trump like a character in a soap opera  but the truth is his language is dangerous. https://t.co/WQ7N12S9u4 We are running a campaign differently than any other candidate. This is a people’s campaign. Together  we will win. https://t.co/fMK6KqYUO8 Let’s say it loud and clear: Our government belongs to all of us  and not just a hand full of billionaires. #Bernie2016 This campaign is about a political revolution — millions of people standing up and saying  enough is enough. https://t.co/5xDqkhRSy1 I’ll be on @FallonTonight coming up in a few minutes. Tune in on @NBC! https://t.co/7T5h1KtUbY We have got to stand together with those who are being attacked and are scared today. https://t.co/wxXUw8zE8b We say NO to cuts in Social Security  a program which is so important to all of our seniors  but especially to women. Not only are we not going to retreat on women's rights  we are going to expand them. We are going forward  not backwards. If you can’t afford to take care of our veterans  then don’t go to war. I’ll be on @FallonTonight! Tune in at 11:35 EST. https://t.co/7WQoYL8x1L Instead of cutting Medicare  or privatizing Medicare  we must join every major nation on earth in recognizing that health care is a right. Sadly  in America today  it is very expensive to be poor. We are not going back to the days when women did not have full access to birth control. Medicare needs to negotiate drug prices with the pharma industry. The Veteran’s Administration does it  Medicare doesn’t - that’s crazy. I want to see our country have one of the highest voter turnouts in the world  not one of the lowest. Demagogues throughout our history have attempted to divide us based on race  gender  sexual orientation or country of origin. The U.S. is a strong nation when we stand together. We are weak when we allow racism and xenophobia to divide us. cc: @realDonaldTrump #ExxonKnew about climate change before anyone else did. Now  they’re lying about it for profit. Enough—we must put #PeopleBeforePolluters. The wealthiest industry in the history of our planet has bribed politicians into ignoring science. Enough is enough! #PeopleBeforeProfits While fossil fuel companies are raking in record profits  climate change ravages our planet and our people. #PeopleBeforeProfits Republicans are more concerned with protecting the profits of Exxon and the coal industry than protecting the planet. #PeopleBeforePolluters We must learn the lesson of Iraq. American troops should not be engaged in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. Happy Hanukkah! I've got a message for corporate America: if you want us to buy your products  start producing them here in the USA. https://t.co/yGiGpmKUTr We are one world and one people. And that belief leads me to the conclusion that we just cannot turn our back on human suffering. Most Americans can pay lower taxes if hedge fund managers who make billions manipulating the market finally pay the taxes they should. Why do we have people working 40 hours and can’t afford to feed their kids? The answer is pretty simple: wages in America are too damn low. .@realbencarson you have offended thousands of our service members who risk their lives to defend our country.  https://t.co/nVOTjI1Kzx Today in America  as the middle class continues to disappear  median family income is $4 100 less than it was in 1999. If men were giving birth to babies  there would not be a lot of discussion regarding the right to choose. It's time for instant background checks  ending the gun show loophole  and banning assault weapons. People don't hunt with assault weapons. We will defend Planned Parenthood. #Solidarity https://t.co/4cRMkGyar7 We're excited to have launched our new @Snapchat! Follow us on the campaign trail: bernie.sanders https://t.co/XVu7YsTzD4 In these difficult times  against vitriolic Republican rhetoric  we must protect a woman's right to choose. #solidarity #nhpolitics Maybe  just maybe  we should be investing in jobs and education rather than jails and incarceration! #fitn https://t.co/WR6u0k0TI0 Defunding Planned Parenthood is part of a smear campaign by people who want to deny women the right to control their bodies. #Solidarity I #StandWithPP and the work they are doing and hope people realize that bitter rhetoric can have unintended consequences. #Solidarity Members of congress  mostly men I should add  are trying to roll back the clock on women’s reproductive rights. We currently have a loophole which enables guns to be sold to people at gun shows without a background check. That has gotta be eliminated. There is something profoundly wrong when one out of seven people throughout the world are struggling to survive on less than $1.25 a day. The goal is to not spend $80 billion a year locking up our people. The goal is to get corporations out of the business of running jails. Any elected official with knowledge that the tape of Laquan McDonald’s murder was being suppressed or improperly withheld should resign. There is something profoundly wrong when 750 million people throughout the world lack access to clean drinking water. When you’re sick  you should be able to access health care. When you go to the hospital  you should not come out in bankruptcy. Is it profoundly wrong that the richest 80 people in the world own more wealth than the bottom half of the population – 3.5 billion people. No one  in my view  should be allowed to profit from putting more people behind bars. “Overcoming poverty is not a task of charity  it is an act of justice... It is man-made and it can be overcome ...” - Nelson Mandela Congress must pass sensible legislation that prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them. Mass shootings are becoming an almost-everyday occurrence in this country. This sickening and senseless gun violence must stop. Make no mistake: The right-wing in this country is waging a war against women. We must ensure that this is a war they are going to lose. One in four black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during their lifetime. This is an unspeakable tragedy. If we're ser­i­ous about cli­mate change  we can’t just talk the talk  we've got to walk the walk and take on power­ful special interests. I want to invest in jobs and education for our young people rather than jails and incarceration. Democracy means one person one vote. It does not mean that the Koch brothers and other billionaires should be able to buy elections. Rosa Parks  by the simple act of sitting down at the front of the bus  inspired a whole community to capture the imagination of the nation. In the world's richest nation  we must do everything possible to get people the medicine they need at a price they can afford. #WorldAIDSDay We have a moral responsibility to combat climate change and leave our children a healthy and habitable planet. Loudly and clearly  we must tell the Republicans: No  we will not cut Social Security benefits for seniors and disabled veterans. I am running for president because 11 million undocumented people cannot continue living in the shadows. We need to rethink the so-called "War on Drugs" and take marijuana out of the federal Controlled Substance Act. We bailed out Wall Street because the banks were "too big to fail.” Guess what? 3 out of the 4 banks are bigger today than they were then. I don’t take corporate PAC money  and if  by some accident  some company sent us money  we would send it back—absolutely. Republicans win when the voter turnout is low. Democrats win when voter turnout is high. #nhpolitics I am running for president because we must protect a woman’s right to choose and we must defend Planned Parenthood. #JJdinner We need to rethink the "War on Drugs" and treat substance abuse as a serious health issue  not a criminal issue. https://t.co/bMU8xYjzU7 I am running for president because we need an economy that works for working families  not just for millionaires and billionaires. #fitn From coast to coast people are crying out for real change. They don't want the same-old  same-old. They want a political revolution. Today  virtually no piece of legislation can get passed unless it has the ok from corporate America. The Republican party is now an extreme right-wing party that is owned by their billionaire campaign contributors. I don't represent large corporations and I don't want their money. We shouldn't be talking about repealing Obamacare. We should be expanding on the progress made to provide health care for all Americans. It's time for the Walton family to pay their workers a living wage and get off of government welfare. I strongly support Planned Parenthood and the work it's doing. I hope people realize that bitter rhetoric can have unintended consequences. Watch @KillerMike's introduction in Atlanta last week... https://t.co/cFYQtatdAf When you're sick  you shouldn't have to worry about finding the money to go to a doctor. https://t.co/G1LRrpn24p We proudly #StandWithPP of Colorado Springs and the brave law enforcement personnel who fought to protect it. Our bill to rebuild our crumbling roads  bridges and infrastructure would support 13 million jobs and drastically reduce underemployment. Working families shouldn't be providing welfare to the Waltons  the wealthiest family in America worth over $136 billion. #BlackFriday With a net worth of more than $136 billion  the six @WalMart heirs own more wealth than the bottom 42% of Americans. #BlackFriday Corporations are not people. https://t.co/zN0AgGrdFy .@Walmart shouldn’t be allowed to pay workers wages so low that many qualify for Medicaid  food stamps  and government housing. #BlackFriday People can have differences of opinion  but to go out of your way to make it harder for people to vote  that is the lowest of the low. It's immoral and unjust to leave tens of millions of Americans without health care. Any health care plan must address that issue. What you're seeing are drug companies raising prices for one reason: because they can. Trust me  that won't happen under my administration. Too often our Native American brothers and sisters have seen corporate profits put ahead of their sovereign rights. https://t.co/UddYqGxuxf “We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom can't exist without economic security and independence.” - FDR We have to boldly transform our energy system away from fossil fuel. And at the same time we must protect the workers in those industries. By taxing Wall Street speculators  we can save middle-class families sending kids to college an average of $9400 each year. Why are we told that it's OK to bring in lettuce and tomatoes from unregulated farms but we cannot bring brand-name drugs across the border? All Americans should be sickened by the video of Laquan McDonald’s murder. https://t.co/RV3cRrq88H We are the only wealthy country on Earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right. Let’s change that. Today  still  too many women and girls are suffering from domestic violence and sexual abuse. #OrangeTheWorld Whether you're living in rural America or living in New York City  you need a decent income in order to provide adequately for your family. We had an election last November in which 63 percent of the people didn't vote. We must engage people back into the democratic system. You have millions of families today who do not know how they're gonna feed their kids tonight. That's a fact. The Koch brothers will be spending more money on this campaign than either Party – just one family. That is oligarchy. We have to pass universal legislation that makes everybody in this country who is 18 or older registered to vote automatically. We need to understand that substance abuse is a health issue  not a criminal issue. #BernieInATL https://t.co/kT8gISW51W Our job is to create an economy that works for all of us and not just a handful of billionaires. #BernieInATL https://t.co/9LF9Zs4EGU If you have economic security  your life is a lot better than people who are struggling every single day. It's very expensive to be poor. Anybody in this country  regardless of their income  should be able to go get a higher education. Must Read: Bernie Sanders' Political Revolution https://t.co/ZPmuna1Zaj https://t.co/CstXWMovZL It's called a rigged economy. And this is how it works: https://t.co/MQG98A6qEG We need millions of people to stand up and fight back  to demand that government represents all of us  not just the one percent. #Bernie2016 I am not just asking for your vote. I am asking for your support the day after the election to get involved in the political revolution. If the environment were a bank it would have been saved by now. I am running for one simple reason: I just do not believe that establishment politics are going to address the issues facing our nation. We should recognize the young DREAMers for what they are  American kids who deserve the right to be in the country they know as home. I’m not running for president to pursue reckless adventures abroad  but to rebuild America’s strength at home. We need a political movement prepared to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation. https://t.co/2GY1Sl9Wxx I believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a fair deal. Full-time minimum-wage workers would see their income go up $6 240 under our plan for raising wages. We need police forces  including leadership and training departments  that reflect the diversity of our communities. As we look back through history  we know women were at the forefront of every progressive victory in this country. https://t.co/aqd67WKiAv It is not acceptable that hedge fund managers pay a lower effective tax rate than nurses or truck drivers. The truth is  you can’t change a corrupt system by taking its money. https://t.co/Fv0NhWLkgu It's very expensive to be poor. #2020Approach We must address the lingering unjust stereotypes that lead us to label black youths as “thugs” and “super-predators.” We cannot jail our way out of health problems like drug addiction or social and economic problems like poverty. #2020Approach We must demilitarize our police forces so they don’t look and act like invading armies. #2020Approach Michael Brown  Eric Garner  Walter Scott  Freddie Gray  Sandra Bland  Tamir Rice  Samuel Dubose  Rekia Boyd and too many more. We have to deal with the most urgent and obvious issue: the killing of African-Americans by police or deaths while in custody. #2020Approach Disappointed that @HillaryClinton doesn’t think we should guarantee health care through a single-payer system saving families $5 000 a year. I’m not running for president because it’s my turn  but because it’s the turn of all of us to live in a nation of hope and opportunity. This great nation and its government belong to all of the people  not to a handful of billionaires  their Super-PACs and their lobbyists. We see undocumented workers taken advantage of by a corporate and political system that plays on fear and forces them into the shadows. It's called a rigged economy. And this is how it works: https://t.co/MQG98zOPg6 We need a movement which  once and for all  will end institutional racism in our country and reform a broken criminal justice system. If you're doing everything right but find it harder and harder to get by  you're not alone. https://t.co/o4MqUQIW5N Today we remember those taken from us and pledge to work to end the violence against the transgender community. #TransDayofRememberance In my view  health care is a right of the people  not a privilege. We will not destroy ISIS by undermining the Constitution and our religious freedoms. What an outrageous and bigoted statement. @realDonaldTrump should be ashamed of himself. https://t.co/KcDIMEQTnT We stand with those who want the truth to be revealed. #Justice4Jamar  https://t.co/9AVdjXBktF One thing is for sure: the billionaire class has never dealt with a threat like ours. And I am sure that if we stand together  we will win. No President can take on corporate interests alone. We need a grassroots political revolution of millions and millions of people. This campaign is not about me. It is about you. If we stand together  if we build a political revolution in this country  there is no limit to what we can accomplish. The bottom line is that ISIS must be destroyed  but it cannot be defeated by the United States alone. #BernieAtGU I believe in equal treatment for African-Americans who are right to proclaim the moral principle that #BlackLivesMatter. Democratic Socialism means that we make it easier for people to vote  not harder. #BernieAtGU I’m not running for president because it’s my turn  but because it’s the turn of all of us to live in a nation of hope and opportunity. Democratic Socialism means that we guarantee health care for all people  not leave 29 million Americans to fend for themselves. #BernieAtGU Democratic socialism means that we cannot allow the greed of the fossil fuel industry to destroy our environment and our planet. #BernieAtGU Democratic socialism means that if someone works forty hours a week  that person will not be living in poverty. #BernieAtGU Democratic socialism means that every person in this country has the right to go to a public college or university tuition free. #BernieAtGU Why is it that unlike most people in the industrialized world  Americans don't know if the food they eat has been genetically altered? If we are serious about protecting the planet and improving our economy  America must focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy. We need to fundamentally change the way Wall Street does business. We should not risk our economy on casino-style gambling. We must do away with the corporate loopholes that currently exist  which enable corporations to pay next to nothing in federal taxes. There is no reason the United States must maintain a bloated military budget which spends almost as much as the rest of the world combined. It is important that the American people stand together and end bigotry. It's absurd that over the past decade the net worth of the top 400 billionaires in this country has doubled to an astronomical $1 trillion. The bottom line is  if we hope to compete in the global economy  we must increase our investment in our transportation infrastructure. Despite advances in technology and increases in productivity  millions of Americas today are still working longer hours for lower wages. A student who studies hard gets hit with insurmountable debt  yet bankers who crashed our economy got a bailout and bonuses. Now is the time  once and for all  to end discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. We cannot continue to let Congress' agenda be set by a billionaire class whose views are profoundly out of step with everyday Americans. We've had enough environmental disasters to learn by now that there must be no new offshore drilling. Not now  not ever. #KeepItInTheGround We have got to fundamentally rewrite our trade policy laws so that American products  not jobs  are our number one export. Fossil fuel companies are willing to destroy the planet for short-term profits. That is incomprehensible. Offshore drilling does not achieve the goals its advocates claim and is not worth the risk. Time to move away from oil  not drill for more. If our democracy is to survive  we need to make this clear: our elections are not  and must never be  for sale to the highest bidder. Between you and me  and everyone else in America  corporations are not people. They don't get a vote and shouldn't be able to buy elections. We must ask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share into Social Security by lifting the income payroll tax to $250 000. My advice for climate change deniers in Congress is to worry more about their children's future and less about their campaign contributors. Our political system by and large is owned and controlled by big money interests. The Exxon Valdez oil spill cost up to $7 billion and the consequences persist today. The evidence is clear. We must keep it in the ground. CEOs are seeing their salaries soar and the gap between the rich and the poor grows wider. That has to do with campaign finance reform. Our country should tell young people: "You can run for office without begging the rich and powerful for campaign contributions." To discourage young people from going to college due to cost isn't just a tragedy for those individuals. It will be a tragedy for our nation Apparently for many in the top 1%  owning and controlling our economy is not enough. They now want to own and control the government. As the threat of oligarchy increases  the major political task we face is to protect our democracy. I have real concerns about the war on drugs  which has destroyed the lives of many people who were never involved in violent activity. Climate change is ultimately not a political issue. It's moral. Now is the time for bold action to save our planet. https://t.co/E843l37uYv New tax breaks for the rich and big corporations may be popular in country clubs  but it's way out of touch with what most Americans want. The ACA guaranteed women access to birth control  no matter whom they work for. Bosses shouldn't be able to take that away. #HandsOffMyBC No matter where you work or what you do  your birth control decisions should be up to you. #HandsOffMyBC https://t.co/jQJ7zsNkOP America is not about attacking the most vulnerable people in our country. We cannot allow that to happen. The government must be vigorous in protecting the American people from terrorism  but you can do that without undermining the Constitution. For far too long  Congress has been set by powerful corporate interests and a right wing that doesn't represent the needs of most Americans. We are fighting a terrorist organization  a barbaric organization that is killing innocent people. We are not fighting a religion. We can feed a senior for an entire year for the cost of one day in the hospital. Let’s expand and support Meals on Wheels. No one will be successful in dividing us. America becomes a greater nation  a stronger nation  when we stand together as one people. We offer our deepest condolences to the people of Brussels and stand with our European allies to offer any necessary assistance. While other nations are guaranteeing health care as a right  we spend more on our military than the next nine nations combined. We should end the regressive policy of government making billions in profits off student loans taken out by low and middle income families. It is not acceptable that as workers have become more productive  their wages and benefits have gone down and profits went to those on top. Congress must begin listening to the majority of Americans who are saying they do not want cuts to Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid. Verizon made $39 billion in profit in 3 years. The workers who made that possible deserve a fair contract. https://t.co/dOXPjrz7dr Don't worry about the profits of fossil fuel companies. They're doing fine. Let's focus on transforming our energy system to save the planet The wealthy have seen their incomes rise immensely in the last 30 years. It is not class warfare to say they don't need another tax break. In a world of so much violence  I just don't believe that government itself should be part of that. We must abolish capital punishment. Mexico's agricultural sector lost 1.3 million jobs in the 10 years after NAFTA. It was a lose-lose for working people both here and there. It's unacceptable that the richest 16 000 families in the U.S. now own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. We can't grow jobs if people don't have enough money to buy products made by other people. Raising the minimum wage is basic economic sense. If we are to prosper in a global economy  we must have the best educational system in the world from childcare through college. It is class warfare when the wealthy buy our elections to get tax breaks for themselves and cut spending to programs the rest of us need. When the United States already requires labeling of more than 3 000 ingredients  there is no practical reason GMOs cannot join that list. When our country's future depends on an educated labor force  we cannot afford to give in to right-wing demands to cut Pell Grant funding. The federal government has a moral obligation to provide meaningful support for the rehabilitation of the men and women they send to war. Greed guides the few on top: Corporate taxes are at a 60-year low but every year they demand more cuts. It's unacceptable that  last year  the top 25 hedge fund managers earned more income than 425 000 public school teachers. It's not a radical idea that a person who works 40 hours a week should not live in dire poverty. We must raise the minimum wage to $15/hour. Enough is enough. It’s time to make banking work for all Americans  not just a handful of wealthy speculators. We owe it to the over 22 million brave veterans living in the United States today to provide the benefits that they have earned and deserve. It is a national disgrace that the United States has the highest childhood poverty rate of any major country on earth.

Refusing to hold hearings on the president's Supreme Court nominee would be unprecedented. #DoYourJobFriday The Republican perspective for decades has been that the poor are to blame for the deficit and they have written their budgets accordingly. Boeing pays no taxes. Verizon gets a refund. Pfizer stashes their money abroad. It is high time we ask these groups to pay their fair share. No  we will not balance the budget on the backs our most vulnerable groups. Too many in this country have already sacrificed enough. Climate change isn’t just a problem for the future – the impacts are apparent here and now. We must act boldly. https://t.co/SUVCt6K1QV It's past time to put the interests of our brave men and women in uniform ahead of the profits of predatory banks. https://t.co/BsRBs26qqu It's beyond belief that in 2016 American kids are being poisoned by tap water. We must rebuild our water infrastructure. #FlintWaterCrisis We give tax breaks to companies that outsource jobs to the tune of $500 billion in a ten-year period. Maybe it’s time to end that absurdity. Despair is not an option - not if you want a decent future for your kids or grandchildren  not if you understand this country's potential. Poverty is not just discomfort  it is often a death sentence. People with income in the bottom 20% die seven years earlier than the top 20%. I don't think many lawmakers know that wages have been stagnant for 35 years. They don't see what people are going through. It's simple  really: Politicians should be working for their constituents' votes  not lobbyists' money. That's not radical. It's democracy. Corporations lobby everyday for lower taxes even though they make record profits and their effective tax rates are at a sixty-year low. Judge Garland is a strong nominee with decades of experience on the bench. @POTUS has done his job. It’s time for Republicans to do theirs.

If we don't act  our grandkids will ask why we allowed fossil fuel companies to rake in record profits while climate change ravages earth. We must work together to make Social Security solvent for our kids and grandchildren by lifting the cap on taxable income above $250 000. The next decade of action on climate change is critical - if we do not act boldly  we will not be able to avoid catastrophic consequences. The Export-Import bank gave taxpayer money to large corporations who then laid off American workers and shipped their jobs overseas. How many times have we heard the myth that what Wall Street did may have been wrong but it wasn’t illegal? Let me help shatter that myth. We can save lives and help many people in need if we begin to understand that addiction is a disease  not a criminal activity. Fossil fuel companies may seem to have a virtually unlimited supply of money and lobbyists in Washington  but together we can defeat them. The deadline for a paid internship with Sen. Sanders this summer is Friday. Apply now: https://t.co/RSKlzhaMT3 As a nation  we need to be more energy independent  less reliant on fossil fuel  and more reliant on local sustainable energy sources. Sometimes it seems we have sadly forgotten about the millions of people lost their jobs  homes  and life savings not all that long ago. The time is now for the wealthy and multinational corporations who are doing phenomenally well to help the middle class rebuild. When our military budget rivals every other nation's combined  we can afford judicious cuts to our military without compromising our safety. The sad reality is we have millions of Americans with less than $8 000 in savings wondering how they are going to retire with dignity. It's outrageous that the median female worker earned $1 337 less last year than she did in 2007. We are all in this together. It is our collective duty to ensure the millions of us who are uninsured have access to quality health care. We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels in order to leave a planet that is healthy and habitable for future generations. The bottom line is a great nation and a strong economy cannot exist alongside a crumbling infrastructure. It's ridiculous that the Walton family is now worth $150 billion today. That is more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of Americans. It is  unacceptable that millionaire hedge fund managers often enjoy an effective tax rate which is lower than their secretaries. Nearly 4 million seniors experience food insecurity. We must ensure that the generation that built our great nation does not go hungry. Our health care system is broken when millions who have health coverage can't afford to see a doctor due to high copayments and deductibles. It is more than irresponsible for my Republican colleagues to risk the future of our planet in order to pander to fossil fuel lobbyists. The test of a great nation is not how many wars we can engage in  but how we can use our strength to resolve conflicts in a peaceful way. We have such a large national debt because George W. Bush gave tax breaks to billionaires and took us into two wars he forgot to pay for. Over and over again  supporters of free trade agreements told us they would create jobs. Over and over again  they have been dead wrong. I believe our country needs to be a leader on the global stage  and that means taking the lead on reversing climate change.

My message to the Export-Import Bank: If you use our money  then you represent American taxpayers  not just multinational corporations. A nation is judged not by how many billionaires and millionaires it has but by how it treats the most vulnerable people among us. The time is long overdue for Congress to start representing the working families of America and not  just wealthy campaign contributors. It is a national disgrace that a significant portion of the people who are homeless in America are veterans. Those concerned about the cost of transitioning to renewable energy should truly fear the cost of failing to do so as soon as possible. Climate change's deadly impacts on our most vulnerable communities makes rapidly addressing greenhouse gas emissions a moral imperative. If you want taxpayers' money  then you must protect their jobs. Not a radical idea. But that idea has yet to come to the Export-Import Bank. A handful of huge financial institutions have too much political power over our nation. They already pose a systemic risk to our democracy. We are at a very strange moment in American history where virtually an entire political party is rejecting science. https://t.co/HUBOFLlkrv Proud of Vermont for passing paid sick leave. It's time for Congress to follow the state's lead and support real family values. Today the 10 largest banks in the US are bigger than they were before we bailed them out because they were too big to fail. It is easy to declare war on other countries. It not so easy to comprehend the unintended consequences of that war. Whose views should we trust on trade legislation? Corporate America or organizations that represent working families and the environment? Why do we pay large fees to withdraw our own money? Big banks must stop acting like loan sharks and start acting like responsible lenders. I believe that as a nation  we must restore our public commitment to providing an affordable  quality higher education to every student. The bottom line is when a person goes to the hospital  that person should not end up in bankruptcy.

Women must have full control over their reproductive health in order to have full control over their lives. #InternationalWomensDay The simple fact is  Americans want to know what is in the food they're eating and whether that food is genetically engineered. The simple fact is that the prices of patented medicines are a significant barrier to access to health for millions of Americans. Everyday  millions of seniors have to juggle with their limited budgets the choice of buying food or medicine. This has got to end! When Wall Street talks  Congress listens. When working class kids talk about being saddled with horrendous debts  who is listening to them? The people who risked their lives in Selma showed that when people stand together for justice nothing is impossible. https://t.co/fjLiX59JEx Making a $1 trillion investment to repair our infrastructure would create 13 million jobs  and that is exactly what we should be doing. Cutting Social Security  a life and death issue for seniors and those with disabilities  isn't just bad economics- it's immoral. It really is frightening when you have a party controlling the House and Senate saying  "You know what? We reject science." Money is not free speech. Elections should not be auctions. In a democracy  we should have the right to elect people based on their ideas. It's unacceptable that Monsanto is more concerned about their own profits than about a consumer's right to know what they are eating. Today we have more wealth inequality than any major country on Earth and the gap between the very rich and everybody else is growing wider. It's absurd that in America  the wealthiest country in the history of the world  more than half of older workers have no retirement savings. I'm not quite sure how anybody lives on $7 600 a year  but the sad reality is we have 20 percent of seniors who live at that level today. The American people want fair elections. They want free elections. They don’t want billionaires buying elections. Police departments in African-American neighborhoods should not look like occupying armies. We must demilitarize our police departments. The American people understand: Taking care of veterans is as much a cost of war as tanks and guns. Our Congress needs to understand it too. Now is the time to move to energy independence  break our dependency on fossil fuel and move to energy efficiency and sustainable energies. The kind of "democracy" the ruling class likes is one where few people vote and the rich contribute huge amounts of money to the candidates. Those who represent the rich and can’t address the needs of ordinary people instead manipulate people’s fear and ignorance to stay in power.

While the economy has made gains the last six years  the reality is  the American middle class has been declining over the past 40 years. Instead of giving more tax breaks to those who don’t need them  we should be expanding nutrition programs and other services for seniors. The sad reality is nearly 4 million American seniors may skip dinner tonight because they do not have enough money to buy food today. The bottom line is  it's more expensive to throw people in jail than to provide them with the training they need for a decent paying job. We have got to make sure that every qualified American in this country who wants to go to college can go to college  regardless of income. When the future of America depends on the education our young people   free public education should not end at high school. It's important to remember that we not only have massive wealth and income inequality  but a power structure which protects that inequality. Bernie's always understood that bad trade deals would pave the way for more lost jobs and more lost factories. https://t.co/05jwlJOgUL The FCC should not let Charter buy Time Warner. Even bigger monopolies won't lower cable and internet prices that are already too high. If we are serious about creating the millions of good paying jobs we desperately need  we must fundamentally rewrite our trade policies. Right now  if you are poor  government turns its back on you  yet it welcomes corporations and their lobbyists. We’ve got it backwards. Democratic socialism means that we must reform a political system today which is not only grossly unfair but  in many respects  corrupt. If you think it's too expensive to take care of veterans  don't send them to war. https://t.co/XImYimD2uw It is absurd that millions of workers are unemployed or underemployed when there is enormous work to be done rebuilding our infrastructure.

Why is it that Republicans can accept and respect the research on cancer but are in denial when it comes to the science of climate change? Most Americans can pay lower taxes if hedge fund managers who make billions manipulating the marketplace finally pay the taxes they should. Low income teens now enroll in college in lower proportions than 2008. Your family income shouldn’t decide whether you get to go to college. Vermont and other states must be allowed to label GMOs.

I believe that as a nation  we must restore our public commitment to providing an affordable  quality higher education to every student. It is totally absurd that you can go out right now and get a lower interest rate on a car loan than you would pay on a student loan. The decreasing cost of wind power shows that we can have a 100 percent clean energy future. https://t.co/xRFvk0KX9l If we're serious about ending climate change  we need to end the polluter welfare that subsidizes increased pollution from fossil fuels. We have got to tell the largest corporations in America to stop dodging taxes and bring jobs back to the United States of America. Medicare-for-all would save the American people and businesses more than $6 trillion over the next decade. https://t.co/S5tpCMfncy Our Medicare drug programs have no cost control measures for one reason: they were written and signed off on by the pharmaceutical industry. We are producing enough to feed the hungry and provide what people need  yet our economy works day after day to make billionaires richer. Many people have the mistaken impression that Congress regulates Wall Street. The real truth is that Wall Street regulates the Congress. In my view  corporations should not be allowed to make a profit by building more jails and keeping more Americans behind bars. No American should have to go without the medication they need because Congress doesn't have the courage to stand up to the drug industry. Do politicians in DC stand with ordinary Americans or will the extraordinary power of billionaire campaign contributors &amp; Big Money prevail? Let us understand that when we stand together  we will always win. When men and women stand together for justice  we win. America has more people behind bars than any major country – more even than China  an authoritarian regime. The bottom line is  we can put end to the nearly 47 million Americans living in poverty by raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. We need to end the race to the bottom. Trade policies should protect  not endanger  the interests of American workers. The very rich seem to want more and more and more  and are prepared to dismantle the existing political order to get it. We can’t let them. Other countries negotiate with drug companies on their citizens' behalf to keep costs down. Our government should be able to do the same. In my view  all Americans  regardless of income  should be able to get the education they need without going deeply in debt. Americans should not have to live in fear that they will die because they cannot afford to take the life-saving medication they need. The two largest private prison operators made a combined $361 million in profits in 2015. We must end the private  for-profit prison racket. NEWS: Sanders Urges Action After New Report Details Private Prison Profits https://t.co/naq0rX3U1u https://t.co/xHy6oiOW8Y It's ridiculous that 21 percent of children in America are living in poverty  the highest in any industrialized country by far. If we're serious about reducing wealth inequality and rebuilding the middle class  we must increase the number of union jobs in our country. The need for real campaign finance reform is not a progressive issue. It is not a conservative issue. It is an American issue. If you work 40 hours a week at the current federal minimum wage  you are making about $15 000 a year. That is undoubtedly a starvation wage. The United States needs to join the rest of the industrialized world by implementing Rx drug policies that work for everybody. It's totally insane that the monthly cost of cancer drugs has more than doubled over the last ten years to $9 900.

This has got to end! It's unacceptable that in our rigged economic system  almost all of the new income and wealth are going to the top one percent. The bottom line is  if workers in this country want to exercise their constitutional right to join a union  they should be allowed to do so. In my view  it's immoral and bad economics to cut Social Security when so many seniors and people with disabilities depend on it. Vermont and other states must be allowed to label GMOs. https://t.co/l2QDzHm04W https://t.co/eeCsZlytLQ People in other countries pay far less for their prescriptions. We should reduce barriers to importation of drugs from Canada and elsewhere. When we put money into the hands of working people  they are going to go out and buy goods  buy services  and that will create jobs. I think it is reasonable to demand that a full time job pay enough to lift a worker out of poverty  not keep them in it. We live in the world's richest nation and yet 37 percent of African American kids and 47 percent of Native American kids live in poverty. Guantanamo has damaged our moral standing and undermined our foreign policy. I'm glad to see a plan to shut it down. https://t.co/7ktovDP7TU How do you have a drug manufactured by the same company  in the same factory sold in Canada for one-tenth the price as in the U.S.? Almost everything FDR proposed - Medicare  a minimum wage - was called socialist. Yet these programs have become the fabric of our nation. No single financial institution should have holdings so extensive that its failure could send the world economy into crisis. It's not a radical idea for the United States to join countries all over the world and allow consumers to know if a product contains GMOs. If we can import tomatoes from Mexico  there is absolutely no reason why we cannot import affordable prescription drugs from Canada. The future of prescription costs in America comes down to this: Do we have the guts to stand up to drug companies who are ripping us off? We clearly need a new approach to prescription drugs in this country when 1 in 5 Americans are unable to afford to fill their prescriptions. The time is long overdue for us to start investing in our young people to help them get the jobs they need to be a part of the middle class. In my view  people have a right to make a telephone call today without that information being collected by the government. At the end of the day  investing in senior nutrition programs saves Americans money by keeping seniors healthy and out of hospitals. It's not a radical idea to have legislation that protects the safety of the American people and their constitutional right of privacy. The fossil fuel industry is destroying the planet with impunity and getting rich while doing it. The views of the billionaire class are profoundly out of step with working Americans  which goes a long way to explain Congress' agenda. If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today  do you know what he would say about the big banks? He would say break 'em up. And he would be right. It is disgraceful that millions of full-time workers live in poverty and millions more must work two or three jobs just to pay their bills. We should give authorities the strong tools they need to investigate suspected terrorists  but laws must also safeguard our civil liberties. We have got to ask the largest corporations in America to stop dodging taxes and bring jobs back to the United States of America. There is a war going on in this country. It is a war being waged by some of the wealthiest and most powerful people against working families One of the reasons for the decline of the middle class and working people is that the trade unions which represent them are under attack. The loss of thousands of factories and millions of good jobs prove we can no longer allow corporations to write our trade deals for us. Real family values are paid sick time  paid family leave and guaranteed vacation time so parents can spend leisure time with their children If the Fed could bail out Wall Street with extremely low interest rates  we can treat graduating college students with the same respect. If we are to rebuild our middle class and be competitive in the global economy  we must join other nations and make college tuition free! Instead of providing low-interest loans to companies that are exporting jobs  we should be investing in businesses creating jobs in the US. Today  1 in 5 seniors experience food insecurity. We should be expanding nutrition programs instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires. We must fundamentally restructure our student loan program so that students are not paying interest rates higher than they pay for car loans If we stay on our current track  children today will have a lower standard of living than their parents. It's the American dream in reverse. This country  this great country  belongs to all of us. We cannot allow it to be controlled by a handful on top who apparently want it all. It is simply morally repugnant that we have privatized prisons all over America. We have got to end the for-profit prison racket. In the coming years  the most powerful political party America won't be the Republican or Democratic Party  but the Koch Brothers Party. Today  a quarter of the nation's bridges have been designated as structurally deficient. Now is the time to invest in our infrastructure. It is unacceptable that in America today  you could be taking a lifesaving drug one day and find out it is no longer available the next. The truth is that we can never repay the debt that we owe to those men and women who put their lives on the line to defend our country. We cannot allow ourselves to be divided by the anti-immigrant and xenophobic hysteria the Republican party has concocted. When we discuss wealth inequality and campaign reform  ultimately we're asking a moral question: What kind of nation do we wish to become? There is no valid reason to restrict a woman’s access to affordable birth control. https://t.co/15Sdpzups9 Our country is great because we are the sons and daughters of immigrants  and I think we should all be very proud of that. This week  millionaires stopped paying into Social Security for 2016. That's absurd. We must lift the cap &amp; expand Social Security. We cannot continue to round up and deport thousands of immigrant families to address a crisis that requires compassion and humane solutions. It is my view that we need to fundamentally rewrite our trade agreements so our largest export does not become decent-paying American jobs. The trade agreements pushed by corporate America are great if you are CEO of a major corporation  but are a disaster for American workers. Congress will never regain the American people's confidence unless we have the guts to stand with working people &amp; take on moneyed interests I am very worried about the US Congress turning its back on science and those who tell us that we have got to cut back on carbon emissions. By breaking up too-big-to-fail banks before they face a crisis  we can ensure a healthy financial system &amp; prevent another taxpayer bailout. If a bank is too big to fail  it's too big to exist. https://t.co/d0a6UiK7yC For decades  we have been engaged in a failed ‘War on Drugs’ with racially-biased mandatory minimums that punish people of color unfairly. We have to deal with the reality that 50% of young black kids are unemployed and that we have massive poverty in America. If we are serious about rebuilding the middle class and creating millions of good jobs  we must fundamentally rewrite our trade policies. For three decades after World War II  productivity and wages grew together. Today  productivity is soaring but workers' wages are stagnant. Democracy means one person  one vote. It does not mean that the Koch Brothers and other billionaires should be able to buy elections. The test of a great nation is not how many wars we can engage in  but how we can use our strength to resolve conflicts in a peaceful way. We need legislation which makes it possible for workers who want to join a union to do so. We must pass the Employee Free Choice Act. Our guiding principle in terms of immigration reform must be to unite families  not divide them up. “We can either have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few.” - Louis Brandeis We will not tolerate calls to send back unaccompanied children and victims of crime and domestic violence to the countries they have fled. How insane is it for us to literally discourage bright young people from attending college because of how much money their parents make? We must listen to the scientific community  not Fox News  and lead the world in reversing climate change. I remain opposed to the free trade agreements like NAFTA that forced American workers to compete against people who make pennies an hour. When people stand together for justice  nothing is impossible. I will never forget Alan Greenspan visiting Congress to tell us how great deregulation was. I didn't buy it then  and I don't buy it now. Today  African American unemployment is double the national average. The struggle for racial and economic justice continues. My thoughts and prayers are with Justice Scalia's family and colleagues  who mourn his passing. Our goal as a nation must be to ensure that no full-time worker lives in poverty. We must raise the minimum wage to at least $15/hour! NEWS: Sanders Backs @SenatorReid's Legislation to Guarantee Due Process for Border Refugees https://t.co/wN5fIFL5Z6 https://t.co/1vrbCtuVVw Republicans need to worry less about their campaign contributions and more about leaving our kids a planet that is healthy and habitable. We have a moral obligation to provide for the wounded and ensure that all veterans receive every benefit they have earned and deserve. Since 2001  our disastrous unfettered ‘free trade’ policies have lost over 4.7 million decent-paying manufacturing jobs. Enough is enough! We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels if we are interested in subsiding the irreversible effects of climate change. There was once a time when our nation's infrastructure - roads  bridges  rail - were the envy of the world. Sadly that's no longer the case. We must end the scandal in which millions of Americans  many earning less than $30K/year  work 50 or 60 hours a week without overtime. It makes no sense that students and their parents are forced to pay interest rates for college loans that are higher than housing mortgages. One of the most serious crisis facing this country is the lack of decent-paying jobs for young Americans. We must defeat this crisis. It's imperative that the one-in-five Americans living with a mental health condition receive care in a timely manner. Higher education is a strategic investment in our nation’s future. That is why education should be a right  not a privilege. The opioid epidemic claims 78 lives each day. We must ensure lifesaving drugs  such as naloxone  are accessible to those who need them. In the 1950s large corporations contributed over 30% of federal tax revenue. Today it's less than 10 and they still ask for more tax breaks. The American people understand that the federal minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage. It is not a wage that anybody can live on. The Koch brothers are spending hundreds of millions so they can have a Congress that works for the 1 percent. We can’t let that happen. It is crazy that we have Republicans who not only will not raise the minimum wage  but want to do away with the concept of a minimum wage. The only major voter fraud we have in America are elected officials enacting voting restrictions to protect their own seats in office. We need trade policies that are designed for the American worker  not for the multinational corporations who are richer than ever before.

It's unacceptable that in the richest countries in the world millions of young people are unable to find work and begin their careers. Change does not take place easily. Anyone who’s read history understands that. What we need is a national health care system that puts people ahead of profits and health ahead of special interests.

Climate change is real and caused by human activity.Our job is to aggressively transform our energy system away from fossil fuels. We need trade policies that work for the working families of our nation and not just the CEOs of large  multi-national corporations. We must learn from other nations who say to their young people: You want to go to college? You can go to college  regardless of your income. While we tackle grotesque levels of income inequality in this country  we must simultaneously address the structural racism so many endure. In 2014  drug makers spent $250 million on lobbying and campaign contributions. Even in DC  that’s a lot of money. https://t.co/A7GDV6nKgx We have a moral responsibility to reduce the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else. The true greatness of a country does not lie in the number of millionaires and billionaires it has. In the year 2016  a job must lift Americans out of poverty  not keep them in it. We have got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Your ability to vote shouldn’t depend on whether you have a car or how much money you have.  It’s your right  plain and simple. Attempts by elected officials to win elections by suppressing voter turnout isn't just political cowardice- it undermines our democracy. In the United States  CEOs make 300 times what their workers make. This is simply immoral and must be dealt with. We must reform our campaign finance system so Congress' work reflects the needs of working families and not the billionaire class. There was once a time when the United States was No. 1 in infrastructure. Today we are No. 12. We need to invest in our infrastructure. Every year  the federal government makes billions of dollars in profits off of student loans. We must end this most revolting practice! It's outrageous that nearly 45% of American households lack any meaningful access to transit. We must rebuild our crumbling infrastructure! America should be known as the country with the best educated population in the world  not the country with the most people in jail! Flashback: Months before the Veterans Affairs scandal was exposed  Bernie tried to expand health care for veterans. https://t.co/61YkDqRPLY The bottom line is that unilateral military action should be the last resort  not the first option. Enough is enough! This great nation belongs to the people and not to a handful of billionaires  their super PACs and their lobbyists. There is no reason why the United States is the only major country on Earth that does not have a family and medical leave policy. There is something profoundly wrong when one family in America  the Walton family of Walmart  owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent. It is my view that we need to fundamentally rewrite our trade agreements so our largest export does not become decent-paying American jobs. Next time you hear a politician talk about family values  ask them where they stand on paid family leave. #FMLA23 In my view  every worker in America should be guaranteed at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave! #FMLA23. It’s disgraceful that America is the only major country that does not provide paid family and medical leave. #FMLA23 https://t.co/qCTxhMEl5B The answer to unemployment and poverty is not and cannot be the mass incarceration of young Americans of all races. There is no reason that American workers should be denied paid family leave  a benefit that workers in every advanced economy already enjoy. I believe it is time for the United States to join almost every other Western  industrialized country and say no to the death penalty. 30% of every health care dollar spent in the United States goes to administrative costs  rather than to delivering care. We can do better. I've always strongly opposed trade agreements like NAFTA and TPP  which were written by corporate America and have cost us millions of jobs. The time is long overdue for us to start investing in our young people and to help them get the jobs and education they need. It's an outrage that we have seen a proliferation of millionaires while ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages. Although Martin Shkreli’s greed is in the national spotlight today  skyrocketing drug prices are a daily struggle for many Americans. Let's face it: until we put patients over profits  our health care system will not work for ordinary Americans. In the United States of America  you should not be forced into bankruptcy because you are diagnosed with cancer. It's outrageous that in the industrialized world  the United States is No. 1 in billionaires and No. 1 in childhood poverty. When millions of working Americans are still living in poverty  it is absolutely imperative that we raise the minimum wage to a living wage. It's outrageous we still have 29 million people in this country who have zero health insurance. This has got to end! When the average Social Security benefit today is just $1 328 a month  it's time to extend and expand Social Security benefits not cut them! If a bank is too big to fail  it is too big to exist. https://t.co/CkPKm80G1X It's unacceptable that Republicans want to cut Social Security  despite the fact that some seniors are trying to survive on $13 000 a year. The bottom line is: do we cut social security benefits or do we ask the wealthiest corporations and Americans to pay their fair share? Big business is willing to destroy the planet for short-term profits. https://t.co/qjq4Ly4mnZ It is simply unacceptable that 40 percent of African American children are living in poverty. We are rapidly moving toward a nation of the super-rich  by the super-rich and for the super-rich. Money and wealth should serve the people. The people should not have to serve money and wealth. It is imperative that we have the courage to stand with the poor  to stand with working people and  when necessary  take on the powerful. We must move towards a democracy where one can run for office without begging for contributions from the wealthy and the powerful. Why is it that  despite huge advancements in technology and productivity  millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages? The American people understand that our current economic system is rigged against them and designed to benefit the top 1%. It’s time to expand Social Security to make sure that everyone in this country can retire with the dignity and respect they deserve. We are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world  but few Americans know it because so much of the new income goes to those on top. It is unacceptable that Americans pay  by far  the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. It is hard for me to understand how one can be concerned about climate change but not vigorously oppose new fossil fuel pipelines. The United States must join the rest of the industrialized world and recognize that healthcare is a right of all  and not a privilege. Instead of sheltering profits in the Cayman Islands  the largest corporations in this country must pay their fair share of taxes! It is an outrage that the CEOs of large corporations are calling for tax breaks while the middle-class of this country is disappearing. "While the income of a minority is increasing exponentially  that of the majority is crumbling." -Pope Francis https://t.co/0PyORMIB2L Between 2008 and 2013  GE  Boeing and Verizon paid no federal income taxes but received $4.1 billion in tax rebates. This has got to end! It makes no sense that kids who get caught with marijuana get police records while Wall St. CEOs who helped destroy the economy get raises. It is an outrage that not one major Wall Street executive has gone to jail for causing the near collapse of the economy. More than twice as many elderly women lived in poverty than men in 2013. We should be expanding not cutting Social Security and Medicare We need to give our kids  regardless of their race or income  a fair shot at attending college and make public universities tuition free. 27% of low wage workers are single parents. We just have got to recognize that the minimum wage we have now is totally inadequate. We'll no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that's been rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans. It’s an outrage that millions of parents are forced back to work because they don’t have the income to stay home with their newborn babies. The gender wage gap has lifelong effects. The average yearly Social Security income received by women is $12 857 compared to $16 590 for men #EqualPay should not be a partisan issue but instead an American issue of basic fairness. #EqualPayCantWait when women in America who do the same work as men earn 79 cents on the dollar. One in every 15 African-American men is incarcerated  compared to one in every 106 white men. That is unacceptable. We must end the disgrace of women making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. We are going to have pay equity for women workers. Across the country millions of people are working 2 or 3 jobs to cobble together enough income and health care to sustain their families. It's unacceptable that the United States is five percent of the world’s population  yet we have 25 percent of the world’s prisoners. If we are serious about protecting the planet and improving our economy  we must focus on efficient  renewable energy and not fossil fuels. Republicans believe starvation wages are enough for millions of hard working Americans. I disagree. We must raise the minimum wage to $15! People who live in low-income and minority communities will bear the most severe consequences of society’s addiction to fossil fuels. 35 million Americans should not have to go without the medication they need because they cannot afford it. https://t.co/jKoNP8f9Pg Oil  coal and electric companies spent a staggering $2.26 billion in lobbying since 2009. Even in Washington  that’s a lot of money. It really is an embarrassment that Republican politicians  with few exceptions  refuse to even recognize the reality of climate change. My definition of democratic socialism is creating a government that works for all of us  not just a handful of people on top. There's already been a massive transfer of wealth in this country- trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class to the few on top. Women are making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men and for women of color it’s even less. That's nothing but sexism and discrimination. What the American economy should be about is fighting to protect the middle class  not indulging the greed of billionaires. I believe that every kid in this country who has the ability and the desire should be able to get a higher education in this country. At a time when more than 10 percent of workers are either unemployed or underemployed  we should be doing everything we can to create jobs. War must be the last choice  not the first option. https://t.co/iRkU4ksXWP In 2015  35 million people didn't get their prescriptions filled because they didn't have enough money. Big Pharma must be held responsible The US needs to join the rest of the industrialized world by implementing prescription drug policies that work for everybody  not just CEOs. Congress needs to listen to the 72 percent of the American people who believe that the cost of medication is too expensive. All of the pundits always tell us what we cannot accomplish until the day after we accomplish it. https://t.co/BkHJbJnMg1 It’s high time we stopped bailing out Wall Street and started repairing Main Street. It's unacceptable that total spending on medicine in the United States has gone up by  more than 90 percent since 2002. We've ended up with a situation where millions of working people's tax rate is a hell of a lot higher than for some of the richest people. Planes and tanks and guns are a cost of war. So is taking care of the men and women who use those weapons and fight our battles. This is almost beyond belief. The wealthiest 14 people in this country saw their wealth increase between 2013 and 2015 by $157 billion. If this country is to succeed in the future  we cannot continue to turn our backs on an entire generation of young people. Americans are carrying more student debt than credit card or auto-loan debt. That’s a tragedy for our young people and for our nation. I have a message for Republicans: Worry less about your campaign contributions and worry more about your children and grandchildren. Today  less than 9 percent of seniors live in poverty. Why do some people insist on cutting Social Security when it has been so effective? Why do Republicans always have money for war but not for those in need? Democracy should not be a war between one group of billionaire donors and another. That's why  we've got to overturn Citizens United. We have a corporate establishment whose greed is destroying our economy  a political establishment which is beholden to billionaires. "The quality of a society  I mean of a civilization  is also judged by how it treats elderly people." -Pope Francis https://t.co/5iGWVzX0Yo Many people have the mistaken impression that Congress regulates Wall Street. The real truth is that Wall Street regulates the Congress. Republicans say: Let’s give more tax breaks to the rich and to the corporations. This is wrong. Trickle-down economics has not worked. The bottom line is that people can’t make it on $7.25 or $8 an hour. We have to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. We must end the greed and selfishness of Wall Street. https://t.co/3yTXHzZEXh 1 out of 5 Americans are unable to afford to purchase the drugs prescribed to them by their doctors. This is totally insane. Not only are we not going to retreat on women's rights  we are going to expand them. When you tell a woman that she can not control her own body  that’s extremism. Corporations should not be allowed to make a profit by building more jails and keeping more Americans behind bars. Too many girls and women are still suffering from domestic violence and sexual abuse and that must end. It's my firm belief that if the US Senate had 83 women and 17 men  women's reproductive rights would never be under question or debated. Increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour would significantly boost the wages of more than 15 million women. The decision about abortion must remain a decision for the woman and her doctor to make  not the government. We have to overturn Citizens United and move to the public funding of election  so the wealthy and the powerful cannot buy elections. If we want a vibrant democracy  where candidates have an even playing field  we need to move toward public funding of elections. Billionaires buying elections is not what our Constitution stands for. https://t.co/k4Ry2weNxp As a result of Citizens United  the Supreme Court has given the wealthiest people an opportunity to own the United States government. 6 years ago today  the Supreme Court issued what I think is one of the most disastrous decisions in its history -- Citizens United. In the US today 50 million people are still uninsured or underinsured. We live in a nation where health care is a privilege for the wealthy. It's unacceptable that many kids have criminal records for smoking marijuana while the CEOs of banks do not. https://t.co/0hbqn16VxZ The United States needs to move toward community policing and make our police departments look more like the communities they serve. If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today  he would say huge financial institutions are too powerful and we need to break 'em up. The Koch brothers are spending huge sums of money to sow doubt about climate change. The reality is climate change is real and man-made. The debate is over. Climate change is real and caused by human activity. This planet and its people are in trouble. https://t.co/7EqOEBDlyX As a society which proclaims human freedom as its goal  the United States must work unceasingly to end discrimination against all people. It's unbelievable that the Koch brothers saw their wealth increase by $18 billion in 2 years  yet paid lower taxes than the middle class. As a nation  we must remain consistent with our immigrant tradition by welcoming those fleeing violence and ending the raids. Our job is to tell every kid in this country  that if they work hard  regardless of family income  they will get a college education. I got a message for the Walton family of Walmart: Get off of welfare and pay your workers a living wage. Are you ready for a radical idea? We are going to create an economy that works for the middle class  not the billionaire class. Americans understand we have a rigged economy  where 47 million people are living in poverty and almost all new income is going to the top. We have to make Congress respond to the needs of the people  not big money. https://t.co/LjZlJnoS0w "This country has socialism for the rich  rugged individualism for the poor." -Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. #MLKDay https://t.co/PXp1Q2ky9w Dr. Martin Luther King: "We must ask the question  ‘Why are there forty million poor people in America?'" #MLKDay "Call it democracy  or call it democratic socialism  but there must be a better distribution of wealth." -Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. #MLKDay Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody  it should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney general's investigation. As we honor Dr. King  we must not only remember what he stood for  but also pledge to continue his vision to transform our country. #MLKDay The black unemployment rate has remained roughly twice as high as the white rate over the last 40 years. This is unacceptable. We need to end prisons for profit  which result in an over-incentive to arrest  jail and detain  in order to keep prison beds full. The war on drugs has been a failure and has ruined the lives of too many people. It's time for the US to join almost every other Western  industrialized country in saying no to the death penalty. https://t.co/EU2u0T6ISe We are spending almost twice as much per capita on health care as does any other nation. https://t.co/xbuY1D5kRc The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised to a living wage! https://t.co/nyXxATTQtx Climate change is real  it is caused by human activity and it is already causing huge devastation across the world. https://t.co/jE2dvMFpfX When you're sick  you should have access to health care. When you go to the hospital  you should not come out in bankruptcy. The measure of success for law enforcement should not be how many people get locked up. https://t.co/3b4n4EcTPG Today  if an employee is engaged in a union organizing campaign  they have a one in five chance of getting fired. This has got to end! It's embarrassing that 20% of kids in America are living in poverty  the highest childhood poverty rate of any major developed country. It is unacceptable that the typical female worker made $1 337 less last year than she did in 2007. We must continue to boldly take on powerful political forces who are more concerned with short-term profits than the future of the planet. We can create a government that works for all of us  not just powerful special interests. This is not a radical idea. We have a moral responsibility to leave our kids a healthy planet. The best way we can do that is by keeping fossil fuels in the ground. Unbelievably  today in many states  it is still legal to fire someone for being gay. That is unacceptable and must change. America should be known as the country with the best educated population in the world  not the country with the most jailed population. We must move away from the militarization of police forces and completely redo how we train police officers. Sen. Ted Kennedy: Health care is "a matter of right and not of privilege." https://t.co/00mhOwzUqF One family will spend more money this election cycle than either the Democratic or Republican parties. This isn't democracy. It's oligarchy. It seems to me that instead of building more jails  maybe  just maybe  we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids. I have spent my career fighting for something that I consider to be a human right. That human right is health care. We're the only major country that doesn’t guarantee healthcare to all as a right  yet we spend more per capita on healthcare than any nation I say to Walmart: Get off of welfare. Start paying your employees a living wage! We'll no longer tolerate an economy and political system rigged by Wall St. to benefit the wealthiest at the expense of everyone else. The greed of the pharmaceutical industry is killing Americans. That cannot continue. 29 million Americans still have no health insurance. We must resolve that health care is a right  not a privilege of those who can afford it We need to change campaign finance so the work being done by Congress reflects the needs of working families  not just the billionaire class There is no rational economic reason why women should earn 78 cents on the dollar compared to men. That has got to change. How is it that we can spend trillions on never ending wars but can't afford to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure? https://t.co/rUzH5WdyT9 I appreciated @POTUS's point that we need more civil politics  to get big money out of politics  and to revitalize American democracy. NEWS: Sanders Statement on the State of the Union Address https://t.co/nca8kzwcYc https://t.co/HOwVYhrWH3 Too much of the Fed’s business is conducted in secret  known only to the bankers on its various boards and committees. Medicare for all would guarantee health care for all people and save middle class families and our entire nation lot of money. This country was built by immigrants. I believe we are a nation that wants to see comprehensive immigration reform passed. Health care should be a right of all people  not a privilege. This is not a radical idea. It exists in every other major country on earth. In my view  corporations should not be allowed to make a profit by building more jails and keeping more Americans behind bars. It makes no sense to me that the United States of America has more jails and prisons than colleges and universities. In 2015  a college degree is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50 years ago. Public colleges should be tuition free. We can live in a nation where everyone  no matter their race  religion or sexual orientation realizes the full promise of equality. In my view  no single financial institution should have holdings so extensive that its failure could send the world economy into crisis. We have a situation now where Wall Street banks are not only too big to fail  they are too big to jail. That has got to change. It is insane and counter-productive that that millions of kids leave school with a mountain of debt that burdens them for decades. As a result of the Citizens United decision  our political system has been totally corrupted and the foundations of democracy undermined. We have more people in jail than any other country on earth including China  an authoritarian country 4 times our size. My Republican colleagues talk a lot about “family values.” https://t.co/2qlySxiOh4 I will do everything I can to stand up to the Donald Trumps of the world and their bigotry and their xenophobia. https://t.co/aHW9GpiLw4 The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised. The minimum wage must become a living wage. We must tell the billionaire class: You cannot continue to get tax breaks while children in this country are going hungry! Over 20 percent of mothers who have jobs in America have to go back to work just two weeks after giving birth. That’s unacceptable. Today  one family  the Walton family of Walmart owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans! That is our economic reality. It is an international embarrassment that nearly 20 percent of kids in America are living in poverty. https://t.co/c6DcpJxUaa If you throw 17 million people off health insurance as Republicans would  people will die because they can't go to a doctor in time. In the United States  CEOs make 300 times what their workers make. That is simply immoral and must be dealt with. Americans will not support a candidate who does not favor raising the minimum wage and who thinks wages in the country are too high. In America today  we not only have massive wealth and income inequality  but a power structure which protects that inequality. The bottom line is that we cannot and we should not sweep up millions of men  women  and children and throw them out of the country. Despite the efforts of many Republicans to suppress the vote  we must make it easier for people to participate in the political process. The US must end the international embarrassment of being the only major country that doesn't guarantee workers paid medical &amp; family leave. Instead of throwing 17 million Americans off of health insurance  we should be expanding on the Affordable Care Act https://t.co/hSPxqFFxJf The American people will not support a candidate who thinks climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese. We need drug policies that work for everybody  not just the CEOs of the pharmaceutical industry. Most Americans can pay lower taxes if hedge fund managers who make billions manipulating the market finally pay the taxes they should. We must make it easier to import lower-cost drugs. Americans should not live in fear that they will go bankrupt if they get sick. 83 Central American immigrants recently denied asylum were murdered within months of their return.  We must immediately cease these raids. I urge @POTUS to immediately cease the deportation raids and not deport families back to countries where a death sentence awaits. The time is long overdue for this great country to join to the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care as a right to all. Our corrupt system allowed Wall Street during the 1990s to spend $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions to get deregulated. American becomes a greater nation when we stand together as one people and loudly and clearly say no to all forms of racism and bigotry. The witch-hunt against Planned Parenthood  which provides critical health care to 3 million women  must end. https://t.co/mCcDpjxjwu The last thing we need is a budget reconciliation bill that throws 17 million Americans off health insurance and defunds Planned Parenthood. We have got to demilitarize our local police departments so they do not look like invading armies. When we talk about our responsibility as human beings  there is nothing more important than leaving this planet healthy and habitable. Right now  our energy policy is rigged to boost the profits of big oil companies like Exxon and BP at the expense of average Americans. One of the reasons that the rich are getting richer while the poor are getting poorer is that we have a corrupt campaign finance system. Not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing our economy's near collapse. Big bankers must not be too big to jail. In my view  it is unacceptable that Americans are paying a $5 fee each time they go to the ATM. Greed  fraud  dishonesty and arrogance  these are the words that best describe the reality of Wall Street today. The decision about abortion must remain a decision for the woman  her family and physician to make  not the government. #StoptheSham Republicans are clearly more loyal to gun lobbyists than our children. I support @POTUS's executive actions to make our communities safer. Wall Street cannot be an island unto itself  gambling trillions of dollars. If a bank is too big to fail  it is too big to exist. When you have so few banks with so much power  you have to not only reestablish Glass-Steagall  but you've got to break them up. It is beyond my comprehension how we can have a major party who deny the reality of what the entire world's scientific community is saying. For the life of me  I will never understand how a family like the Koch brothers worth $85 billion apparently think that's not enough money. This is the richest country in the history of the world. Millions of our people should not be living in poverty. Instead of giving huge tax breaks to the wealthy  we should pay attention to the needs of seniors trying to survive on just $12 000 a year. We judge a country not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it produces  but by how it treats the most vulnerable people. How is it that a kid who smokes marijuana gets a police record  but the CEO of a company that ruins people’s lives has no criminal record. We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. We should be investing in jobs and education  not more jail and incarceration. What Republicans are saying  very loudly and clearly  is that no woman in this country  has the right to control her own body. I disagree. The debate is over. Climate change is real  and it’s caused by human activity. What we have to do is not let Donald Trump and these other people divide us up. "The most serious of the evils that afflict the world these days are youth unemployment &amp; the loneliness of the old" https://t.co/RwHNLruvW6 The benchmark of full time work in America should be simple and concrete – that no full-time worker should live in poverty. What do the Koch brothers want? Let me tell you. They don’t just want to cut Social Security  they want to eliminate Social Security. Today  one family  the Walton family of Walmart  owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans! Over half of American workers have less than $10 000 in savings and have no idea how they will be able to retire with any shred of dignity. We have a system that treats too many citizens who have not committed crimes like criminals. That's a reality that must change. Americans should not have to live in fear that they will go bankrupt if they get sick. We need a movement which once and for all will end institutional racism in our country and reform a very broken criminal justice system. It is grossly unfair that there are millionaires in this country who end up paying an effective tax rate lower than a middle-class worker. It's not a radical concept that maybe the United States government should represent working families rather than a handful of billionaires. People should not have to go without the medication they need just because politicians aren’t willing to challenge the drug lobby. It is not a radical idea to say if a person works 40 hours a week that person should not live in poverty. Happy New Year! Today in America over 20% of our children are living in poverty — the highest rate of childhood poverty of nearly any major country. The billionaire class cannot have it all. Our government belongs to all of us  and not just the one percent. We cannot jail our way out of health problems like drug addiction or social and economic problems like poverty. When Republicans talk about family values  they're talking about defunding Planned Parenthood. Access to health care is a human right  and that includes access to safe and affordable prescription drugs. The fact that on any given night there are fifty thousand homeless veterans on the street is a national disgrace. Unlike Trump  who wants to give huge tax breaks to his fellow billionaires  we need to ask the wealthiest people to pay their fair share. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality billionaires like Donald Trump should pay their fair share of taxes. To say to some smart  young person: you're not going to be able to go to college because your family lacks the funds. That is pretty dumb. 11 million people cannot continue living in the shadows. We need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship. Republicans must start worrying about the planet they will leave their kids  not the campaign contributions they get from the Koch brothers. It makes no sense that every year we lose $100 billion in tax revenue because profitable corporations stash their profits in tax havens. Loudly and clearly  we must tell Republicans. No. We will not cut Social Security benefits for the elderly and disabled veterans. I have a message for Donald Trump: No  we’re not going to hate Latinos  we’re not going to hate Muslims  we are going to stand together. Many young people are leaving school deeply in debt for what? For the crime of trying to get an education and make it to the middle class. We need major reforms in a very broken criminal justice system. We must stop the killing of unarmed African-Americans by the police. We need to invest $1 trillion to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create up to 13 million decent-paying jobs. Our foreign policy has failed the American people and led to wars like the war in Iraq which we should never have gotten into. We are living in a rigged economy where corporate profits soar while millions of our children live in poverty. Republicans win elections when people don’t vote  when they turn off from politics. Progressives win when people know what’s going on. Donald Trump wants to give billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top three tenths of 1 percent. That's not the America we need. Nobody can recall a Christmas Eve where the temperature was 65 degrees. Why is it that we're not effectively addressing climate change? The way we improve lives is by passing legislation which creates millions of decent paying jobs  not by having us hate Mexicans or Muslims. We need a constitutional amendment that will overturn Citizens United and restore free and fair elections. We need policies that bring us together  take on the greed of Wall St. and create an economy that works for all of us  rather than a few. Donald Trump does not want to raise the minimum wage. In fact  he has said that he thinks wages in America are too high. This nation and its government belong to all of the people  and not solely to a handful of billionaires  their super PACs and lobbyists. Elections should be influenced by grassroots movements not a billionaire’s checkbook. We have seen far too many people  often African Americans  who are unarmed  shot and killed by police officers. https://t.co/qA6Apb2B8J There is nothing that is more important than passing on an earth that is healthy and habitable for our kids and grandchildren. It's time to end religious bigotry and build a nation where we all stand together and condemn the anti-Muslim rhetoric. Nearly two-thirds of the electorate didn't vote in 2014. It's clear we need radical change to bring more people into the political system. The Koch brothers intend to spend $750 million on this election. That's more than either the Democratic or Republican Party will spend. Over the last 30 years there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent. There is something profoundly wrong when the top one-tenth of one percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. You have families out there paying 6  8  10 percent on student debt but you can refinance your homes at 3 percent. What sense is that? We have a major health care crisis. 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions more can't afford to go to the doctor. Why is it that the United States today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right? I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country  not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from. We must bring people together to take on the powerful who've hurt the middle class. Trump is trying to play on fears and divide us up. Merry Christmas from the Sanders family! https://t.co/mSi6GX0674 Our nation has always been a refuge for the oppressed. We need to take steps to protect children and families  not cast them out. Blacks are imprisoned at six times the rate of whites. That is unacceptable. I consider reforming our criminal justice system one of the most important things we must do. I want the word to go out to every kid that if you study hard  regardless of your family's income  you will be able to go to college. Addiction is a disease  not a criminal activity. I want a new foreign policy that destroys ISIS but does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East. We have a campaign finance system which is corrupt. https://t.co/7GHpLfNF5c I do not want to be liked by everybody. I want to be liked and supported by working families because I am going to take on Wall Street. Our government belongs to all of us  and not just the hand full of billionaires. We've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are heavily influencing the political process. I do not want to be liked by everybody. There comes a time when you have to take on the establishment and not be part of that establishment. Regime change without worrying about what happens the day after you get rid of the dictator doesn't make sense. https://t.co/FrZKVfZGkQ Scapegoating minorities is not going to solve the problems facing our country. We need to reform a very broken criminal justice system. https://t.co/kUMYQIv8rn We are going to provide free tuition to public colleges and universities by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation. The greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans. We cannot just destroying ISIS. We must make sure we do it in a way that leads to a better future and more stability in the region. The greed of corporate America is destroying our economy. They've got to be confronted. We need changes in the power structure of America. We need pay equity for women workers. Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. In my view  we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians. Three out of four of the largest banks are larger today than when we bailed them out. If they're too big to fail they're too big to exist. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate to contribute money and troops to destroy ISIS with American support. I know I have been considered to be very  very radical but on almost every issue that I’m talking about there is vast support among people. The greed of corporate America and Wall Street is destroying the economy of the United States. These guys have got to be confronted. We are living in a country that is moving quite rapidly toward an economic and political oligarchy  where a handful of people have control. Understand that Donald Trump thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea. He thinks low wages are a good idea. Martin Luther King Jr. was right when he said: “This country has socialism for the rich  and rugged individualism for the poor." True freedom does not occur without economic security. In other words  people are not truly free when they are unable to feed their family. In the United States today  we have more income and wealth inequality than at any time since 1928. Anyone think that makes sense? The minimum wage was originally described as “socialist.”  Today it is seen as the foundation of the middle class. The great middle class of America  once the envy of the entire world  has been disappearing. We must address this economic and moral issue. Congress must pass legislation that make our rigged political and economic systems work for the vast majority of Americans not just the 1%. The truth is we can't afford another spending package that expands the billionaire class's power and wealth at the expense of everyone else. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised to a living wage. Since the Wall Street crash of 2008  more than 58% of all new income has gone to the top 1%. We must make our economy work for the 99%. In the year 2015  a job must lift workers out of poverty  not keep them in it. In my view  and I feel this very strongly  instead of locking up our young people  maybe it’s time we found jobs and education for them. The United States must join the rest of the industrialized world and recognize that healthcare is a right of all  and not a privilege. The invasion of Iraq was a horrendous mistake. I don't want to see that repeated. I don't want to see the US going alone into the region. It's time for the United States to join almost every other Western  industrialized country on earth in saying no to the death penalty. Most new wealth flows to the top 1%. The system is rigged and held in place by corrupt politics where billionaires buy elections. I am calling on all of us in public life and all Americans to condemn anti-Muslim hatred  to say “no” to those who promote this hatred. It is time to say enough is enough. It is time to end religious bigotry. It is time to build a nation in which we all stand together. I intend to do everything I can  in every way  to combat the xenophobia and racist rhetoric coming from Donald Trump and others. Playing on people’s fears is counterproductive. We cannot continue to label entire people as terrorists or criminals or rapists. The decision about abortion must remain a decision for a woman and her doctor to make  not the government. You have a right to health care regardless of whether you are rich or poor. America's always been a haven for the oppressed. We cannot shirk the historic role of the US as a protector of vulnerable people. #GOPDebate We must keep our country safe  but we can do that without undermining the constitutional and privacy rights which make us free. #GOPDebate We need to stop using prisons as a response to poverty. In the richest country in the history of the world people shouldn't have to be working 50 or 60 hours a week to put food on the table. Just as planes and tanks and guns are a cost of war  so is taking care of the men and women who we sent off to fight the war. I believe strongly we can protect our people without undermining our constitutional rights. I worry we're moving to an Orwellian society. We can defeat ISIS without getting ourselves involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. https://t.co/EbdJdVlXlC Young people should be able to get an education regardless of income. What's radical about that? My nightmare is that 20 or 30 years later  we're still talking about how we get out of Syria and Iraq. https://t.co/7Hrf5o1oKD When people put their lives on the line to defend our country  I believe we have a moral responsibility to help them get the best healthcare We are one of only 13 nations in the entire world  that doesn’t guarantee workers a paid vacation. Is that a family value? Since #SandyHook Congress has done nothing to prevent this senseless violence from happening again. That is unacceptable. We must act now. Greed  unquenchable greed  is destroying our country. And a few people cannot have it all  while children in America go hungry. If we do not change the system  a black male born today stands a one in four chance of spending time in prison. That is unacceptable. Greed is destroying our economy. What we need to do is create an economy that works for all of us not just the top 1%. At the end of the day  providing a path to go to college is a helluva lot cheaper than putting people on a path to jail. We have a Republican Party which is much more interested in contributions from the fossil fuel industry than about the future of the planet. We are the only major nation in the world that doesn’t guarantee paid time off for new parents. That's a travesty. It's an embarrassment. We’ve got to stand up to the fossil fuel industry and fight for legislation that transforms our energy system away from fossil fuels. Instead of listening to the demands of the pharmaceutical industry  it is time that Congress started listening to the American people. While the #ParisAgreement is a step forward it goes nowhere near far enough. The planet is in crisis. We need bold action now. The federal government will make $110 billion in profit on student loan programs over the next decade. This is morally wrong. Citizens United has enabled billionaires &amp; special interests to increasingly control the political system &amp; amounts to legalized bribery. I don’t think it’s a radical idea that in the richest country in the history of the world health care should be a right  not a privilege. Sadly  in America today  it is very expensive to be poor. Why do Republicans refuse to acknowledge the reality of climate change? Simple. They receive billions of dollars from fossil fuel companies. How irresponsible can we be to ignore what the entire scientific community is saying? If we're serious about dealing with the threat of climate change  we need to end polluter welfare that subsidizes increased pollution. During difficult times as Americans  we cannot succumb to racism. We will not allow ourselves to be divided and succumb to Islamophobia. A working person making $12 000 a year is in no way equal in political power to somebody who is the head of a large corporation or bank. At a time when elderly women are more likely than men to be living in poverty  we must expand--not cut--social security. Bernie meets the Bernie Bear. https://t.co/PfeCP7a5a9 NEWS: Sanders Introduces Bill to Cut Carbon Emissions 80 Percent https://t.co/WGgUyfsUKo https://t.co/seGilRqq0v We are not going back to the days when women had to risk their lives to end an unwanted pregnancy. We cannot turn away from people who are fleeing Syria and Iraq with just the clothes on their backs. The world must respond. #HumanRightsDay Corporations cannot be allowed to stash their money in the Cayman Islands. We have to reinvest in America &amp; make education available to all. There's been a massive transfer of wealth from the 99% to the top 1%. We've got to bring that money back to working families. We have 47 million people living in poverty  36% of African-American children are living in poverty. This is an issue we must deal with. Nearly 50 million Americans had trouble paying their medical bills last year. When you go to the hospital you shouldn't emerge in bankruptcy Throughout history we’ve had demagogues trying to divert attention away from the real issues. Now Donald Trump is trying to divide us up. I don't think it's very hard to understand that terrorists or potential terrorists should not have guns. We have got to be as aggressive as we can in destroying ISIS  but we have to learn the lessons of the past. That means we cannot do it alone We need a budget that will ensure pay equity for women workers. It is unacceptable that women earn 79 cents for every dollar a man earns. People who are barred from flying on airplanes should not have guns. We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve. If men gave birth to babies  there would not be a lot of discussion regarding the right to choose. If we keep burning fossil fuels we'll experience cataclysmic consequences. We must leave the vast majority of fossil fuels in the ground. Demagogues throughout our history have attempted to divide us based on race  gender  sexual orientation or country of origin. It’s time to take on the fossil fuel billionaires  accelerate our transition to clean energy and put people before the profits of polluters. Sadly  we now have a Republican Party that is more concerned about protecting the profits of Exxon  BP and Shell than protecting the planet. President Obama is right. ISIS will be destroyed with an international coalition. https://t.co/BzIW0RMqlT We cannot and should not be trapped in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. https://t.co/8Y6gRjW5FC We cannot and should not sweep up millions of people  many of whom have been here for years  and throw them out of the country. There must be no new offshore drilling. Not now  not ever. https://t.co/aZmSTVk1pd We must say to the fossil fuel industry: "Sorry  your short term profits are less important than the future of our planet.” We have a major crisis in opiate addiction. We need a revolution in mental health treatment so all people can get the help they need. When you are sick  you should be able to access health care and see a doctor. That is not a radical idea. When youth unemployment and underemployment is at 30 or 40 or 50% we need to invest in jobs and education  not more jails and incarceration. If we can import lettuce from Mexico  why can't we import safe and affordable prescription drugs from Canada. https://t.co/JrJyyY4z3f The reason why the American people are angry is that Congress is not addressing the real problems that are impacting Americans every day. Last year  nearly one in five Americans – 35 million people – did not get their prescriptions filled because they did not have enough money. When there are major crises facing our country  why are we debating a bill that throws 17 million Americans off health insurance? The American people are angry because Congress is not addressing the real problems that are impacting their lives each and every day. The defunding of Planned Parenthood is part of a long-term smear campaign by people who want to deny women the right to control their bodies The vast majority of the American people support gun safety legislation. Congress must act now. https://t.co/ZdpTGMIkTo We need sensible legislation that prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them. The San Bernardino shooting was the 355th mass shooting this year.  Gun violence has reached epidemic levels in the US. It must end. Mass shootings are becoming an almost-everyday occurrence in this country. This sickening and senseless gun violence must stop. We must stop the war on Planned Parenthood and make sure women have the ability to control their own bodies #StandWithPP Republicans must end the witch-hunt against Planned Parenthood  which provides critical health care to millions of Americans #StandWithPP We cannot let our students leave school with a burdensome mountain of debt. Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free. The pope was right when he said climate change is getting worse and that unless we act "we are at the limits of suicide." #COP21 In America  millionaires and billionaires should not be able to buy elections. We must overturn Citizens United. Instead of defunding Planned Parenthood  we should be expanding it so that every woman in this country gets the health care she needs. Instead of throwing 17 million Americans off health insurance  we should expand on the ACA to make health care a right  not a privilege. The biggest problem in caring for those with AIDS is no longer a scientific problem  the crisis is access to affordable drugs. #WorldAIDSDay It is morally wrong when the federal government makes over $1 billion on student loan programs. Student loan interest rates must be lowered. We must take on the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off Americans  so people can afford the drugs they need to live. #WorldAIDSDay The scientific community could not be clearer. Climate change is real  man-made and causing severe damage that we can no longer ignore. Republicans must start worrying about the planet they will leave their kids  not the contributions they get from the fossil fuel industry. We must tell Republicans: No  we will not cut Social Security benefits for the elderly and disabled veterans. We must expand benefits. We are living in a rigged economy. Corporate profits  are soaring while millions of our children live in poverty. The economic and political systems of this country are stacked against ordinary Americans. https://t.co/bB5kalL2EA Americans should not have to live in fear that they will die because they cannot afford to take the life-saving medication they need. My goal is to get corporations out of the business of running jails and do away with mandatory-minimum sentencing. I despise appeals to nativism and prejudice and believe in immigration reform that gives aspiring Americans a pathway to citizenship. Pope Francis: "Rampant capitalism has taught us the logic of profit at all costs..." https://t.co/S4neC5U3rx Most Americans can pay lower taxes if hedge fund managers who make billions manipulating the market finally pay the taxes they should. We are one world and one people. And that belief leads me to the conclusion that we just cannot turn our back on human suffering. We must give people confidence that we have a criminal-justice system that works for all  regardless of their wealth or power. I strongly support Planned Parenthood and its work and hope people realize that bitter rhetoric can have unintended consequences. NEWS: Sanders Statement on Colorado Planned Parenthood Shooting https://t.co/U4LPypkU8j https://t.co/boL2bQLECS You have millions of families today who do not know how they're gonna feed their kids tonight. That is a fact. The Walton family of Walmart own more wealth than the bottom 42% of Americans combined. #BlackFriday By taxing Wall Street speculators  we can save middle-class families sending kids to college an average of $9 400 a year. The failure to prosecute the crooks on Wall Street for their illegal behavior is a clear indictment of our broken criminal justice system. It's immoral and unjust to leave tens of millions of Americans without health care. As we gather with our loved ones to give thanks today  we should reflect on the fact that not all families will be so lucky. "The third freedom is freedom from want." -President Franklin Delano Roosevelt https://t.co/yTD6DOzD22 Congress does not regulate Wall Street  Wall Street regulates Congress. The big banks are just too powerful. Criminal justice reform must be the civil rights issue of the 21st century. 99% of all new income generated today goes to the top 1%. Does anybody think that that is the kind of economy this country should have? Too many girls and women are still suffering from domestic violence and sexual abuse and that must end. #orangetheworld It is absurd that corporations are allowed to make a profit by building more jails and keeping more Americans behind bars. When the United States is the only developed country without mandatory paid sick leave  the American people and the economy suffer. A real family value is when new parents are allowed to stay home with their newborn children. NEWS: Sanders is the most popular senator in America with an approval rating of 83% https://t.co/qh3FjmqMXs The Koch brothers will spend more money on this campaign than either the Democrats or GOP. That is oligarchy and will only get worse. When a parent is forced to send their sick child to school because they cannot afford to stay home with that child that isn't a family value When millions of people stand up and fight we win. Thanks for being one of our 1 million followers on Twitter! https://t.co/z9RrOxGSLj It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week  that person should not be living in poverty. Must Read: If America really valued mothers  we wouldn’t treat them like this -@ezraklein https://t.co/IAsq1KHirZ https://t.co/DfBxQZLaCF We must not accept a nation in which billionaires compete as to the size of their super-yachts  while veterans sleep out on the streets. When over half of Americans have less than $10 000 in savings  we shouldn't be talking about cutting Social Security. We should be expand it In America today  we should not have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on earth. One in four black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during their lifetime. This is an unspeakable tragedy. If Teddy Roosevelt  a good Republican  were alive today  you know what he'd say? "Break up the big banks." And he would be right. When we put money into the hands of working people  they're going to buy goods and they're going to create jobs in doing that. As a result of a corrupt campaign finance system Congress isn't listening to the American people. It's listening to the big money interests. It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids. The US is the only major country that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right  not a privilege. That is an embarrassment. If you're gonna work 40 hours a week  you shouldn't live in poverty. We have to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. People should not be using the political process to inject racism into the debate. Billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers. That makes no sense at all. Democratic socialism means that we must create an economy that works for all  not just the very wealthy. Too many people have suffered and too many people have died for us to continue to hear racist words coming from major political leaders. Donald Trump's statement is outrageous and bigoted. We will not destroy ISIS by undermining the Constitution. https://t.co/yVD0NG6WKw I don't believe in special treatment for the top 1%... https://t.co/gjR4obeBLO When 63% of people don’t vote and 80% of young people don’t vote  that's not a democratic system. Democratic Socialism means that we must reform our political system which is not only grossly unfair but  in many respects  corrupt. The drug companies never lose. As a result  we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Real freedom must include economic security. https://t.co/abyr2fi6Ih What we saw in Paris was disgusting and barbaric. But we are a strong enough nation to say we’re not going to lose who we are as a people. If we turn our backs on refugees  we will be destroying what this country is supposed to be about. https://t.co/WNS845xigH We have to boldly transform our energy system away from fossil fuel while also protecting the workers in those industries. When the people are not involved  politicians respond to lobbyists and donors. When people speak up  we can make Congress work for families. The top 4 pharmaceutical companies made $57 billion in profits last year and spent more on sales and marketing than research &amp; development If you think it is too expensive to take care of our veterans  don't send them to war. https://t.co/elk4i3h7Ax We bailed out Wall Street. It's their turn to bail out the middle class and help our kids go to college tuition-free. Now is the time to unite the world in an organized campaign against ISIS that will eliminate the stain of ISIS from this world It is an embarrassment that with few exceptions Republicans refuse to recognize the reality of climate change. Today’s vote to block the Clean Power Plan is a reminder that Republicans are more concerned with campaign contributions than our planet. In the last 30 years there has been a massive redistribution of wealth. The problem is this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction. We spend over $600 billion a year on the military yet  significantly less than 10% of that money is used to fight international terrorism. Let’s be clear: a life saving prescription drug does not do anyone any good if they cannot afford to fill that prescription. We must do what we do best and that is be Americans – fighting racism  fighting xenophobia  fighting fear. If the environment were a bank it would have been saved already. The decision about abortion must remain a decision for the woman and her doctor to make  not the government. If the minimum wage had kept pace with productivity  it would be more than $16 per hour today. It's unconscionable that millions of new parents are forced back to work because they can't afford to stay home with their newborn babies. It's unacceptable that millions of college graduates can't afford to buy their first home or car because of outrageously high student debt. We have a moral responsibility to prevent the most severe climate change impacts that fall overwhelmingly upon the poor and most vulnerable No one should go bankrupt or skip getting the care they need because they cannot afford it The greed of the pharmaceutical industry is killing Americans.  It has got to stop. We must preserve a woman's right to control her own body. https://t.co/qv87dpAv5w In America today  we are seeing the richest getting richer  and almost everyone else becoming poorer. Enough is enough! We cannot let our grandchildren wonder why we did nothing about climate change. We must take bold action to transform our energy system now. I'll do all I can to make sure the US doesn't get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq  one of our worst foreign policy blunders Citizens United has opened up the road to oligarchy in the United States. This is a real danger to American democracy. Higher education is a right. We must fight to ensure that every American can go to college without living in debt. As a nation of immigrants  it is our moral duty to make a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million people living in the shadows. Americans are becoming much sicker and in some cases dying because they cannot afford the drugs they're prescribed. https://t.co/3DNwSxrHHt How is it that we can afford to allow 1 in 4 major corporations to not pay federal income taxes but we can't afford to help our veterans? If you can't afford to take care of your veterans then you do not go to war. We have a moral obligation to keep our promise to provide for every veteran and their families. https://t.co/L2rsq5fI2T If patriotism or love of country means anything  it means that we do not now  or ever  turn our backs on those who defended us. #VeteransDay America becomes a stronger nation when we stand together as one people and say no to all forms of racism and bigotry. Today  as we honor the brave men and women who risk their lives to defend us  we must commit to care for our veterans every day of the year. The average CEO now makes nearly 300 times more than the average worker. https://t.co/uoVJRJRxlw The $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage is a starvation wage. It has got to be raised to a living wage! https://t.co/f9OZShQwkt We cannot and should not sweep up millions of poeple – many of whom have been in the US for years – and throw them out of the country. American immigration policy should be about uniting families  not separating families. I stand with the thousands of workers on strike today to demand $15 and a union. #FightFor15 Companies should not be making profits by incarcerating people in this country. Democracy means one person one vote. It does not mean that the Koch brothers and other billionaires should be able to buy elections. When you’re sick  you should be able to access health care. When you go to the hospital  you should not come out in bankruptcy. It is not an American value to talk about rounding up millions of people and throwing them out of the country. That is xenophobia. We have got to move toward public funding of elections so that candidates in the future are not dependent on big money interests. Make no mistake: The right-wing in this country is waging a war against women. We must ensure that this is a war they are going to lose. If the Republicans can't face a free election  they should get another job. Pope Francis: "The quality of a society...is also judged by how it treats elderly people." https://t.co/aSuZ3HsjXb As we look back through history  we know women were at the forefront of every progressive victory in this country. https://t.co/WPrCsYaEgq I want to invest in jobs and education for our young people rather than jails and incarceration. We have to end this absurd voter suppression which is intentionally denying low-income people  people of color &amp; seniors the ability to vote In my view  Democrats will not win unless we run campaigns which generate excitement and momentum and which produces a large voter turnout. Anybody who suppresses the vote  who intentionally tries to keep people from voting  is a political coward. They are undermining democracy. Democratic socialism means having a government that represents the needs of the vast majority of Americans rather than just the top 1%. As someone who has led the opposition to #KeystoneXL from Day 1  I strongly applaud the president's decision to kill this project. It's insane to support the excavation and transportation of some of the dirtiest fuel. I strongly applaud the decision to kill #KeystoneXL. Student debt has surpassed credit card debt and is now the second-largest source of personal indebtedness. That is unacceptable. Too often our Native American brothers and sisters have seen corporate profits put ahead of their sovereign rights. https://t.co/QYOnoFlOz4 Senior citizens in America should not have to choose between food  medicine or heating their homes. https://t.co/wsZf38ZTwF The evidence suggests Exxon lied about climate change to protect their profits.

If we're ser­i­ous about cli­mate change  we can’t just talk the talk  we've got to walk the walk and take on power­ful special interests. It is unacceptable that millions of senior citizens and disabled veterans did not receive a cost-of-living adjustment this year. We have to stand up to the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy. The Koch brothers do not want to make life better for ordinary people. https://t.co/LIUVleNJgW It is absurd that at a time when we should be cutting carbon emissions  we are instead extracting even more fossil fuels on public lands. To Republicans who reject the science on climate change  I say worry less about your campaign contributions and more about your children. What we need now is a political movement of millions of people to transform American society. The same old same old just won't do it. It's a disgrace that millions of full-time workers are living in poverty &amp; many more are forced to work 2 or 3 jobs just to pay their bills. Election Day should be a national holiday so that everyone has the time and opportunity to vote. https://t.co/dg7YGOWVBI If we are serious about combating climate change we have to do all we can to prevent the excavation of the dirtiest fossil fuels #KeystoneXL When you tell a woman that she cannot control her own body  that's extremism. https://t.co/Q9Zfqwhh09 African Americans are much more likely to be arrested for using marijuana than will whites.

All over this country people are working two or three jobs  yet they can’t afford child care or to send their kids to college. As the largest and most powerful military in the world  we need to use military force as a last resort  not a first option. Americans have more student debt than credit card or auto-loan debt. That is a tragedy for our young people and our nation. A key pathway to the middle class runs through college  but rising costs are making it harder for Americans to get the education they need. Instead of sending American jobs to China  corporate America has got to re-invest in this country and create decent-paying jobs in America. Instead of giving tax breaks to millionaires  we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of decent-paying jobs.

The time is long overdue for us to take marijuana off the federal government’s list of outlawed drugs. A lot of Republican candidates talk about family values. What they are saying is that no woman should have the right to control her own body It is an embarrassment that we have a major political party that rejects the overwhelming science on climate change. Too many Americans have seen their lives destroyed because they have criminal records as a result of marijuana use. That has got to change. Democrats win when people come out. Republicans win when their big money buys low voter turnout elections. Republicans win when voter turnout is low. When people become demoralized. When they don't think their vote matters. Our civil liberties and right to privacy shouldn’t be the price we pay for security. It is totally unacceptable that Americans are drowning in $1.3 trillion in student loan debt. https://t.co/iHEiT29ui4 The American people are angry because they know this recession was not caused by the middle class and working families of this country.

A mom and a dad should have the right to at least a couple of weeks of paid vacation so they can spend quality time with their kids.

A college degree is the new high school diploma. An education should be available to all regardless of anyone’s station. We need to end minimum sentencing. Too many lives have been destroyed for non-violent crimes. You do not balance the budget on the backs of the most vulnerable people and ask nothing from the wealthy and profitable corporations. Republicans talk about "family values" but the US is the only major country that doesn't guarantee paid family leave https://t.co/a169p4NFnu Exxon Mobil knew the truth about fossil fuels and climate change and lied to protect their business model at the expense of the planet. We've seen a rapid movement toward oligarchy  toward a government owned and controlled by a handful of extremely wealthy families. It's a national disgrace that so many qualified young Americans do not go to college because they cannot afford it. https://t.co/DVMmTBQw6B Democratic Socialism means democracy. It means creating a government that represents all of us  not just the wealthiest people in America. We have a moral responsibility to lead the world and transform our energy system away from fossil fuels. One of the biggest mistakes our government made after the financial crisis was not prosecuting the people responsible. China – not exactly seen as a model when it comes to human rights – provides 14 weeks of paid maternity leave. The US provides zero. Anyone 18 years of age or older should be automatically registered to vote. http://t.co/NLuDSMdKBG More than half of workers between the ages of 55 and 64 have no retirement savings at all. We must ensure everyone can retire with dignity. If we could bail out Wall Street  we can make sure that every American can go to college without going into debt. We should not be the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all of its people as a right of citizenship. The only way we really transform America is through a political revolution. http://t.co/zLPSCMyuPy 29 million Americans still have no health insurance. A Medicare for all system would guarantee health care as a right. We need comprehensive immigration reform &amp; a path towards citizenship to take 11 million undocumented people in America out of the shadows. I want young people to be able to run for office and not have to beg for money from rich people and corporations. http://t.co/42q5lJDY6A 100 years ago we said every kid should be able to get a high school education for free. The same is true of a college education today. Congress does not regulate Wall Street  Wall Street regulates Congress. We have to break up the big banks. How many billions will be used to elect candidates who only represent the rich and the super rich? The decision to end a pregnancy should be made in consultation with a doctor without interference or judgment from politicians. Out of 185 countries  the U.S. is one of only two that does not grant paid maternity leave. Papua New Guinea is the other. I want Wall Street to help kids in this country attend public colleges and universities tuition-free with a Wall Street speculation tax. If we do not address the global crisis of climate change  the planet we'll leave our kids may well not be habitable. That is a major crisis. I do not consider myself part of the casino-capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little. People who graduated in 2014 with student debt owed an average of $30 000 each. That’s unsustainable and unforgivable. I don’t believe it is a terribly radical idea to say that someone who works 40 hours a week should not be living in poverty. If you're serious about climate change  you cannot encourage the excavation and transportation of very dirty oil.

It is not acceptable that Latinos make up more than 16% of our population but have only 2.2% of the nation’s wealth. We can no longer tolerate a criminal justice system that treats Wall Street executives as too big to jail. http://t.co/HLyGlUtqLq It is our moral responsibility to leave this planet in a way that is habitable and healthy for our children and our grandchildren. When unions grow  the middle class grows. And when the middle class grows  America does well. It is an outrage that not one major Wall Street executive has gone to jail for causing the near collapse of the economy. Guns should not be in the hands of people who shouldn't have them and that means we need a very strong instant background check system.

Republicans are once again taking us to the edge of a government shutdown  demanding we take away health care from the American people. We need to end the tragic reality that the United States has more people in jail than any other country on earth. Super PACs are playing a very destructive role in our political system. American democracy is not about billionaires buying elections. We need to get the government out of the business of profiteering off working class student debt. Pope Francis in his address to Congress: http://t.co/Od3N4UOYXj Only 18% of families headed by single moms have economic security. That is unacceptable. You can go into a drug store &amp; find the price for a drug has double or tripled over night &amp; we can't do anything about it. That must change. At a time when our planet is warming due to climate change  the last thing our environment needs is more drilling. http://t.co/EpyjzAB62c Social Security is the most successful government program in our history.

Pope Francis has issued us a call that we should embrace. #PopeInDC http://t.co/xKpktFVLQw The pope is saying that money  the accumulation of money and the worship of money is not what life should be about. Pope Francis is calling for a social and economic system that lives in harmony with nature  not one that destroys the planet. #PopeInDC Money does rule  and that is why  in my view  we have got to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections. Republicans should stop politicizing the right of women in this country to control their own bodies.

Donald Trump is a phony  a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. (1/2) A person so untrustworthy and dishonest as Hillary Clinton must not become president. But a Trump nomination enables her victory. Trump relishes any poll that reflects what he thinks of himself. But polls are also saying that he will lose to Hillary Clinton Trump says he admires Vladimir Putin  while he has called George W. Bush a liar. That is a twisted example of evil trumping good. Another #bombshell? Trump should authorize the @nytimes to release the transcript of his ed board interview. #WhatIsHeHiding A disqualifying &amp; disgusting response by @realDonaldTrump to the KKK. His coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America. .@realDonaldTrump got it wrong: I released back taxes in Jan '12  early in primary process--just like he should do. https://t.co/VrLgnEnNI7 .@realDonaldTrump taxes for last 4+ years are still being audited. There are more #bombshells or he would release them. No legit reason @realDonaldTrump can't release returns while being audited  but if scared  release earlier returns no longer under audit. Methinks the Donald doth protest too much. Show voters your back taxes  @realDonaldTrump. #WhatIsHeHiding The case for waiting for the next president to name the next SCOTUS nominee was well expressed by Joe Biden. https://t.co/CofEma012N .@JebBush followed his family's pattern of putting country above himself. I am proud to call him a friend.  https://t.co/AxtPzgtqac Hey @ABC: put @CarlyFiorina on the debate stage! She got more Iowa votes than John and Chris. Don't exclude only woman. 4 years ago today  I released my taxes; became issue. 2016 candidates should release taxes before first contests. .@tedcruz is a "natural born citizen." Obama too. Even George Romney. This isn't the issue you're looking for. Merry Christmas from our family to yours. https://t.co/rbwDf8MJmD Important distinction: thug Putin kills journalists and opponents; our presidents kill terrorists and enemy combatants. Tired of Obama's dissembling. No one calling for massive troop intervention. Instead calling for winning strategy to replace current failure The City of Light became a city of tears. America weeps with you. I got the first #SpeakerSelfie. https://t.co/IF92lXMkw7 Of course  no religious test for the presidency--every faith adds to our national character. Treasuring what's most important in life. http://t.co/OpH6yClUmw The difference between @SenJohnMcCain and @realDonaldTrump: Trump shot himself down. McCain and American veterans are true heroes. Take down the #ConfederateFlag at the SC Capitol. To many  it is a symbol of racial hatred. Remove it now to honor #Charleston victims.

President Obama may ignore @netanyahu  but he cannot ignore the truth he spoke. A flimsy Iran deal amounts to presidential malpractice. With the angels  we weep today for Kayla Mueller  the Chapel Hill victims  and the scores killed in Syria and Ukraine. As we remember #RonaldReagan on his birthday  let’s celebrate his legacy of optimism that inspires Americans even today. I’ve decided it is best to give other leaders in the Party the opportunity to become our next nominee https://t.co/56pcErahDB Mr. Obama  wonder why my concern about poverty? The record number of poor in your term  and your record of failure to remedy. True to form  the President in his State of the Union speech is more interested in politics than in leadership #sotu https://t.co/DTKQVy03Ck Merry Christmas from the Romney family. http://t.co/VBuvPYLrge More "we give  they get" diplomacy from Obama; this time the Castros win  and the champions of freedom and democracy lose. #Cuba .@SonyPictures don’t cave  fight: release @TheInterview free online globally.

Unemployment is higher today than when @BarackObama took office. Think about that. #CantAfford4More Jobless rate is higher today than it was when @BarackObama took office. Sad reminder that the economy is at a virtual standstill. Under @BarackObama  gas prices have skyrocketed.

Together  we will restore the promise of America. http://t.co/XWsktdDe While @BarackObama has refused to act  American workers have lost their jobs &amp; China has become the world's top manufacturer. Mr. President  America has not dictated to other nations. America has freed other nations from dictators. America must lead and for that to happen we must have a strong economy here at home. #CantAfford4More Attacking me is not an agenda. #CantAfford4More .@BarackObama’s foreign policy is unraveling in the Middle East &amp; our national security is threatened throughout the world #CantAfford4More Americans have had enough of @BarackObama’s stale rhetoric &amp; canned excuses. We need real leadership http://t.co/VK9Idi4a #CantAfford4More .@BarackObama says he’s only had four years  but four years was all I needed in MA to turn the state around http://t.co/tT8wuzUv Congrats to the Detroit @Tigers on making it to the World Series! Part of the heart and soul of Detroit. We must save our military from @BarackObama's defense cuts. Today  300+ former sr military leaders join our cause: http://t.co/SGfnEi6b .@BarackObama's policies aren't working for women. Women can't afford four more years like the last four years. http://t.co/aJZ3GFFH The choice is clear for the next 4 years. @BarackObama's policies will drive up middle-class taxes  produce fewer jobs http://t.co/VQlOkIs0 As gas prices continue to rise  even @BarackObama admits he doesn't have a comprehensive energy policy. http://t.co/sSMj9zkt .@BarackObama has amassed more debt than any other president. A 2nd term would threaten to drive the debt to a record $20T. #CantAfford4More The US is blessed with courageous friends. Happy Birthday to the Iron Lady  Margaret Thatcher - a tower of strength in the cause of liberty. .@BarackObama &amp; @JoeBiden don't have a record to run on  or a plan for the future.

Billy Graham and his son Franklin Graham today http://t.co/8VCK7hky It is time to change course in the Middle East. America must have confidence in our cause  clarity in our purpose  and resolve in our might. The 21st century began with terror  war  and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom  peace  and prosperity. Even @BarackObama's own campaign has admitted that he is spreading falsehoods about my tax plan.   http://t.co/bUB94B6Z Women have had enough of @BarackObama’s disappointment. We need new leadership to get our economy growing again. http://t.co/7AcQZb9e Today’s disappointing unemployment report is not what a real recovery looks like. We can’t afford another four years like the last. .@BarackObama can’t defend his record &amp; has no new ideas to run on. It’s time to get America working again. http://t.co/MLJU2fWm I will keep America strong &amp; get the middle class working again. We can’t afford 4 more years like the last 4 years. http://t.co/MLJU2fWm A clear choice. America can’t afford another four years like the last. Donate $15 now: http://t.co/v46AT4HB #CantAfford4More Obamacare will raise taxes on nearly 5 million middle class Americans by 2016 #CantAfford4More http://t.co/8vD3ZuYs Medicare under @BarackObama: Obamacare cuts $716 billion from medicare #CantAfford4More http://t.co/DoMTR42s Agree with @JoeBiden  the middle class has been buried the last 4 years  which is why we need a change in November #CantAfford4More .@BarackObama has spent nearly 4 years implementing policies that have destroyed jobs. We can’t afford 4 more. Economic freedom is the only force in history that has consistently lifted people out of poverty – and kept people out of poverty. We don't need any more slogans.  What we need is leadership http://t.co/ifnLvCQb Efforts that promote hard work and personal responsibility over government dependency make America strong. Candidate Obama's slogan in 2008 was ‘Yes  we can.’ His slogan now is ‘No  I can’t.’ It's time for a new president. .@BarackObama said today “you can’t change Washington from the inside.” RT if you agree. The dreamers and the entrepreneurs  not government  built this economy  and they can once again make it strong. I am running for president to get us creating wealth again – not to redistribute it. Free people and free enterprise create growth and opportunity  not government redistribution. http://t.co/QhlXWvN6 We believe in free people &amp; free enterprise  not redistribution. The right course is to create growth &amp; wealth  not to redistribute wealth. Candidate @BarackObama promised to not pass our bills on to the next generation  yet he’s increased the debt by $5.4T Ann and I extend our warmest wishes to the Jewish Community for a happy and peaceful year. L’Shanah Tovah. In remembrance  let us recall what the flag symbolizes &amp; the many who have sacrificed so that we may fly it proudly http://t.co/Zyn1AU30 On this most somber day  America is united under God in its quest for peace and freedom at home and across the world. The President is required by law to tell the people how he would implement defense cuts  but chooses to ignore the deadline for doing so. If last night was the party  this morning is the hangover. 43 straight months of unemployment above 8%. America deserves better. At the 2008 #DNC  @BarackObama promised Americans a better future  but it’s clear he hasn’t lived up to his promises. At the 2008 #DNC  @BarackObama criticized an economy with high unemployment  but today unemployment is even higher. Before @BarackObama took office  the U.S. ranked 1st in global competitiveness – today marks our 4th year of decline. Instead of delivering more jobs &amp; higher incomes  @BarackObama’s policies have left the middle class in worse shape. #AreYouBetterOff .@BarackObama grades himself “incomplete” on the economy  but what happened to the “one-term proposition?” If @BarackObama can’t even give himself a passing grade  why would the American people give him 4 more years? $16T and counting. After promising to cut the deficit in half  @BarackObama has presided over four straight trillion-dollar deficits. We don't belong to government  the government belongs to us. Labor Day is a chance to celebrate the strong American work ethic  but too many Americans are worrying when their next paycheck will come. When it comes to job creation  @BarackObama is 0-23 million. If your coach has that kind of record  you get a new coach http://t.co/Gx81o6kT What a week here at #GOP2012. November 6th is around the corner – let's get to work. #BelieveInAmerica #RomneyRyan2012 This is a vote for what kind of America we’re going to have - I vote for freedom &amp; free people #BelieveInAmerica http://t.co/aAC9iWJp Our economy runs on freedom  not government. It’s time we put our faith back in the American people #BelieveInAmerica #RomneyRyan2012 I’m running for president because I know my vision will help strengthen the middle class &amp; restore America’s promise #BelieveInAmerica Our Plan for a Stronger Middle Class will create 12 million new jobs &amp; higher take-home pay #BelieveInAmerica #RomneyRyan2012 .@BarackObama looks at government as the source of our greatness. I look at the American people as the source of our greatness. #WeBuiltIt When you attack success like @BarackObama has  you will see less of it. Celebrate your achievements  http://t.co/HDHhcNhJ #WeBuiltIt Neil Armstrong today takes his place in the hall of heroes. The moon will miss its first son of earth. Interesting that @BarackObama admits that he cut $716 billion from Medicare from current seniors to pay for Obamacare. Mr. President  take your campaign of division and anger and hate back to Chicago http://t.co/UQIdadpJ If your priority is creating more jobs and putting more people to work  that's what we know how to do. #RomneyRyan2012 I am proud to announce @PaulRyanVP as my VP.  Stand with us today.  http://t.co/0lH4WbTW #RomneyRyan2012 In almost 4 years as president  @BarackObama hasn't visited Israel. We need a leader who stands with our allies http://t.co/nTjMQ0ew In order to rebuild our economy  we need to encourage the success of hard working entrepreneurs  not tear them down. http://t.co/zkQG1UzI Ron Paul’s “Audit The Fed” bill is a reminder of his tireless efforts to promote sound money and a more transparent Federal Reserve. RT and tell @BarackObama that hard-working individuals create successful businesses  not government http://t.co/NsJj78Ts Being president is not about telling stories. Being president is about leading  and President Obama has failed to lead. With so many around the world still consigned to tyranny  today we appreciate the blessing of liberty &amp; are thankful that we are Americans. .@BarackObama's healthcare promises have fallen short. RT and share this infographic if you agree http://t.co/a4lCksvR If we want to get rid of Obamacare  we’re going to have to replace @BarackObama http://t.co/PKKYZNwk #FullRepeal Thank you to those who stormed the beaches  took the cliffs and freed a continent.

Period. Trump was right to skip CPAC. The votes are in Kansas not Washington. Why give the anti-trump activists a target Trump's shift toward inclusiveness  team effort and unity was vitally important He has to build a Reagan like inclusiveness to win this fall Trump's decision to hold a serious press conference instead of a campaign speech was masterful and a great contrast to Cruz and Rubio. .@realDonaldTrump will dominate tomorrow's #SuperTuesday elections. https://t.co/7trSqmeftj https://t.co/AFvvvijOWL Any media effort to suggest Trump has not disavowed David Duke is just wrong.

I'll be making a major speech on extremism today - how we can tackle the poisonous Islamist ideology that is so hostile to British values. Ten years on from the 7/7 London attacks  the threat continues to be as real as it is deadly – but we will never be cowed by terrorism. The world has lost a great man. We must never forget Sir Nicholas Winton's humanity in saving so many children from the Holocaust. I've asked for a national minute's silence on Friday at noon in memory of those murdered in the Tunisia terror attacks. I am sickened by the attacks in Tunisia  France and Kuwait.

We stand with the French people in the fight against terror and defending the freedom of the press. Happy New Year! The news from Pakistan is deeply shocking.

It's an appalling way to behave and I won't be paying it on Dec 1st I'm appalled by today's attack in Ottawa. I offer my full support to @pmharper and the Canadian people as they deal with this incident. I'm meeting security chiefs this morning to discuss the barbaric murder of Alan Henning. His killers will be hunted down and face justice. The brutal murder of Alan Henning by ISIL shows just how barbaric these terrorists are. My thoughts are with his wife and their children. Sending my very best wishes to Muslims in Britain - and around the world - celebrating #Eid al-Adha. Eid Mubarak to you and your families! We have heard the voice of Scotland and now the millions of voices of England must also be heard. #IndyRef I've just spoken to Alex Salmond  congratulating him on a hard-fought campaign. I'm delighted the SNP will join talks on further devolution. I've spoken to Alistair Darling - and congratulated him on an well-fought campaign. #indyref We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice  however long it takes. The murder of David Haines is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude. Many congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. I'm delighted by the happy news that they're expecting another baby. The UK Threat Level from international terrorism has been raised to Severe. We will respond calmly and purposefully  but without compromise. I've just spoken to President Putin. I made clear he must ensure access to the crash site so the victims can have proper funerals. I'm saddened by the news that the bodies of 3 kidnapped Israeli boys have been found. This was an appalling and inexcusable act of terror. I'm deeply saddened to hear that Stephen Sutton has died. His spirit  bravery and fundraising for cancer research were all an inspiration. Congratulations to the gay couples who have already been married - and my best wishes to those about to be on this historic day. I've been speaking to @BarackObama about the situation in Ukraine. We are united in condemnation of Russia's actions. http://t.co/7Rk2k8iOIK I spoke to @BarackObama tonight. We agreed Russia's actions are unacceptable &amp; there must be significant costs if they don't change course. Because of the serious situation in Ukraine  @WilliamJHague &amp; I believe it would be wrong for UK Ministers to attend the Sochi Paralympics. A great light has gone out in the world.

It was a privilege to watch @Andy_Murray making history at #Wimbledon  and making Britain proud. We will never buckle to terror Sir Alex Ferguson’s achievement at #MUFC has been exceptional. Hopefully his retirement will make life a little easier for my team #AVFC Lady Thatcher didn’t just lead our country  she saved our country. It was with great sadness that I learned of Lady Thatcher’s death. We have lost a great leader  a great Prime Minister  and a great Briton.

Words have consequences: https://t.co/iguejsLebR Last night's #GOPDebate made it clear who was prepared and who has the best grasp of the issues facing our country. https://t.co/p81iuUERdl If you vote for me  when I’m elected president  this generation will do its part. #GOPDebate https://t.co/YVauc3drL1 Leadership is about using the anger to motivate us  not to define us. #GOPDebate https://t.co/XzNURqThC5 .@realDonaldTrump — this is what a "good deal" with Cuba would actually look like: #GOPDebate https://t.co/Su90kJGVzg I'm not interested in being politically correct. I'm interested in being correct. #GOPDebate https://t.co/PSx5yP1Fk8 If we make the right choice in this election  our children will be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. #GOPDebate I understand people are angry &amp; frustrated.

My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families who are impacted by the terrorist attacks in Brussels. #prayforbrussels We are so blessed to live in such a great country. No matter where you're from or what you look like  you can accomplish your dreams. Never allow politics to become your spiritual food because  at the end of the day  our lives have far greater meaning. We have a responsibility to tone down the rhetoric. We're not each other's enemy. I pray for unity in our country. We are stronger when we work together. Last night's results further illustrate that we must unify as a party to defeat the Democrats and their destructive polices. Any candidate I endorsed would have caused a backlash. My decision was principled and not selfish. We must unify to defeat Clinton. There is enormous wasteful spending throughout government. Thomas Jefferson said it is immoral to pass debt to the next generation. Read my new article in @thehill titled  "What happened to the American dream?" https://t.co/XxVLn7ZTmB The power resides with  "We The People" not the government. Tune in tomorrow morning at 7AM ET. I will be on the @TODAYshow with @MLauer and @SavannahGuthrie. We as a nation can not allow our political differences to divide us and lead to acts of aggression and strife. A house divided cannot stand. Please read my full endorsement of @realDonaldTrump  for President of the United States: https://t.co/aSx9u3Ayz1. I endorse @realDonaldTrump. It’s time to unite behind the candidate who will beat Hillary Clinton and return government to  "We the People" Many people fight for change in DC. @realDonaldTrump is a leader with an outsider’s perspective &amp; the vision  guts &amp; energy to get it done. I am so humbled by the 56 percent support in the News 13/Bay News 9 survey of Florida voters who still believe in me. God bless &amp; thank you. https://t.co/mYfP53M7x6 Read my statement on the 2016 election and my future role in the fight to restore power to We the People: https://t.co/0KnVUqhyJD Looking forward to speaking at #CPAC this afternoon and having the opportunity to address the important issues facing our nation. Read my statement on this Thursday night's #GOPDebate. Click here: https://t.co/sdaoZQ303N Obamacare has upended the patient-doctor relationship  restricting our options &amp; access to doctors and specialists. https://t.co/8f0cgaMkSC From my visit to Bellevue Baptist Church. It is my hope that faith will continue to be a part of our nation. https://t.co/nWWL9lCbLS Incredibly grateful to all of our staff and volunteers that worked incredibly hard in #SuperTuesday states across the country. We are a country that is divided and America needs a leader that can bring people together and begin the process of healing our nation. Still time to vote in today's #SuperTuesday states. If you honor me with your support  I will work tirelessly to heal our nation. We the People deserve leaders that are beholden to the Constitution &amp; the American people alone. Not the political elite &amp; special interests https://t.co/h7cNUuAINB We must destroy terrorists’ caliphate and prevent its members from infiltrating our homeland. My strategy will defeat these threats. Legal immigration will always be a valued pillar of our society  but we must do better to protect our homeland and ensure our security. The fiscal irresponsibility in government must stop. We can't go on mortgaging our future to wasteful spending &amp; pretend nothing is wrong. Thanks for the great picture! Our future generations are the reason why we must fight to save our country today. https://t.co/wfC1c2zdGN The overwhelming majority of Americans want our borders secured and our immigration laws enforced by the government. The sanctity of innocent human life is nonnegotiable. We must protect the rights of our children without question. #ProLife Do not be anxious about anything  but in every situation  by prayer and petition  with thanksgiving  present your requests to God. As President  I would direct a fundamental transformation of how  we care for and empower our veterans throughout America. I will formally declare war on the Islamic State as part of a strategy that focuses the national will &amp; protects the American way of life. Check out my closing statement from last night's #GOPDebate. Together  we can heal  inspire  and revive our nation. https://t.co/bxBZzJyxLg We are a nation of immigrants  but we are also a sovereign nation of laws. Our sovereignty demands that we protect our borders. Our adversaries no longer fear us and our allies no longer trust us. We must revive American strength abroad to ensure peace at home. #TheseHands are working to heal America. https://t.co/jdveAaiax3 https://t.co/bTyNTkrqAC The IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them. #GOPDebate https://t.co/hWUSHeUU9O Real compassion is providing people a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependency. #GOPDebate We need to be looking for solutions -- it's not about any candidate. It's about the American people. #GOPDebate https://t.co/WKrNaKnGLV Be our light in dark places  Lord. Be a beacon when we have lost sight of You. May we always remember your love and mercy in all that we do. We the People are not meant to be subservient to an overbearing  bureaucratic government. The American people deserve much better. Government derives its power from We the People. Our Founding Fathers never intended it to be the other way around. We can fix this nation. Commit to the Lord whatever you do  and he will establish your plans. - Proverbs 16:3 I humbly ask the people of South Carolina to give me their vote. I'm running for President to empower We the People and save our nation. Our service men and women deserve the greatest care available. The current state of the VA is disgraceful and we must do better. Just as the United States saw the threat and opposed the spread of communism  it must now oppose the spread of radical islamic terrorism. Honored to have the opportunity to speak with our soldiers at The Citadel in Charleston  South Carolina. https://t.co/kzLI8HsKpw Our service men and women are heroes that deserve the best treatment and care available after they finish their service to our nation. Our service men and women deserve the best treatment available. Our federal government must do better. As President  I will do better. Our politics has become about attacking one another and not the issues. There's a difference between truth and tearing down your opponents. Sadly  in the greatest democracy in the world  the federal government no longer serves America. It serves itself. https://t.co/guWSZQaaDV The government is meant to serve the people. Our Founding Fathers did not intend for America to be beholden to an overreaching bureaucracy. America deserves leaders that conduct themselves with integrity  civility  and honesty. I refuse to engage in the politics of smear tactics. America can not stand idly by while the Islamic State continues to persecute societies and perpetrate terrorist acts against the free world. May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him  so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. I entered this race as a member of We the People. As President  I will be a champion for America. #GOPDebate https://t.co/NvoPf2h2BX Let your truth be known  Lord. May your Word heal our broken nation and replenish our land. We put our trust and all that we are in you. We are a nation of immigrants  but we are also a sovereign nation of laws. Our sovereignty demands that we protect our borders. An amazing crowd tonight at @winterjamtour in South Carolina! I loved the energy and enthusiasm. #WinterJam https://t.co/wZKMRC0Wij Government is meant to derive its power from the American people  and not the other way around as progressives would have you believe. I believe  as Teddy Roosevelt did  that anyone who comes to our country must accept our laws  our Constitution and our values. Our service men and women deserve the best resources available &amp; as President  I'll make sure that they receive the treatment they deserve. America’s national security strength begins with its military  but our military supremacy has been weakened by Obama's administration. As President  I will fervently defend the Constitution  and ensure that the government serves the people and not the other way around. We wouldn't be a free country if it wasn't for our veterans who protect and serve this nation. They deserve better. https://t.co/xGvzg7kBL6 I am committed to protecting innocent life  especially when it is most vulnerable. The sanctity of life is something that we must defend. The existence of an organization like Planned Parenthood is proof that we have become numb to the horrors perpetrated against innocent life. Therefore  my dear brothers and sisters  stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord. I am a candidate that will stand on the side of integrity and honesty instead of on the side of the "Washington Way". https://t.co/HFxslpCITZ I believe in the Constitution and empowering We the People -- not capitulating to special interest groups and the political elite. Lord  use me as your vessel. Give me the words to say and allow me to speak the truth boldly. Let your will be done through me. Our political election process should be about discussing the issues and working towards building a better nation for the American people. As the media discovers more facts surrounding Ted Cruz's campaign resorting to dirty tricks  even they are appalled. https://t.co/sOieTvJy8o With 9 Republicans left  I call on the RNC to get rid of arbitrary requirements for debates. Americans deserve to hear from every candidate. These kinds of political tactics have to stop. "Voicemails: ‘Carson Suspending Campaign'" https://t.co/TVIG6KhhYL via @BreitbartNews Legal immigration will always be a valued pillar of our society but we need to restore the rule of law and keep our nation safe &amp; sovereign. Very much looking forward to the National Prayer Breakfast tomorrow -- an event that holds a very special place in my heart. Anyone who comes to this country and wants to be a part of it must accept our laws  our Constitution and our national values. The most important task of the government is to keep Americans safe. Obama has failed at confronting the grave threats to our security. Our government is bloated with bureaucracy and inefficiency. We the People deserve a government that is accountable to those they represent. As President  I will wage war against #ISIS and work tirelessly to ensure our national security. Americans must know that their government is there to serve them — not itself. I will restore integrity so government is held accountable. Thank you for the amazing outpouring of support yesterday in Iowa. I am more determined than ever to win this election for We the People! Shameless tactics &amp; dirty political plays defined yesterdays #iacaucus. There is no place for this kind of behavior. https://t.co/qodiVHTiQ2 I humbly ask the people of Iowa to consider caucusing for a candidate that will fiercely defend the Constitution. I am that candidate. The mainstream media is fixated on nonsensical issues and pointless bickering  none of which does any good for our nation. As President  I promise to be a defender of the Constitution  a protector of our nation  and a champion of all Americans. Therefore  my dear brothers and sisters  stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord... "It was Thomas Jefferson who said  it is immoral to borrow money from the next generation." #iacaucus I gladly confess that I was the only one at the #GOPDebate with no political title. Politicians are not telling the truth to We the People. "Despite having the least opportunity to speak at tonight’s debate  Dr. Ben Carson said the most." -General Bob Dees https://t.co/xbXKju8aiO I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy. #GOPDebate https://t.co/jbhXfj1YFs We need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies because it's going to kill us if we don't. #GOPDebate You don't have to be a politician to tell the truth. Lord  let your wisdom be my words tonight. I stand aside  among your people  a servant leader -- ready and resolute to let your will be done Just as the United States opposed the spread of Communism in every form and in every place  it must now oppose the spread of the terrorism. As President  I will unify the national will to confront Radical Islamic Terrorism  destroy our enemy  and protect the homeland. I want to be President because I want to ensure a better future for the next generation. https://t.co/5YyAXUNPhY So we fix our eyes not on what is seen  but on what is unseen  since what is seen is temporary  but what is unseen is eternal. The single  most important task of the U.S. government is to keep Americans safe. President Obama has been ineffective and hapless. The sanctity of human life is something that we must wholeheartedly promote and enforce. As President  I will defend life. #WhyWeMarch Thank you to @TexasTech for flying their flag at half-mast in honor of Red Raider and volunteer Braden Joplin. https://t.co/vBfrTXGJmA We reflect on the preciousness of life and honor the memory of Braden Joplin. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/gPltYRjIqD Rest In Peace Braden Joplin. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family. https://t.co/p87TCnD44p I'm suspending all campaign activities today due to a car accident involving members of our team. Full statement: https://t.co/Uf9HZrn2P6 My approach as President will be to listen to We the People instead of listening to Politicians and special interest groups. #BC2DC16 I stand against the liberal progressives who filed a lawsuit in Ohio to take "In God We Trust" off of our currency. https://t.co/5q960RibfP Take It Easy  Glenn Frey  it's your turn for that Peaceful Easy Feeling. For the rest of us it's gonna be a Heartache Tonight #TheEagles For I know the plans I have for you " declares the Lord  “plans to prosper you and not to harm you  plans to give you hope and a future. One of the biggest problems we have is that we've taken the power out of the hands of the people and put it in the hands of politicians. America will lose this election if we continue this childish bickering. Progressive liberals want us to argue. We must do better. https://t.co/RXVhZOViuy If a progressive liberal makes 2-3 Supreme Court picks  our country is over as we know it. #GOPDebate "Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government" &amp; yet you Mr. President excessively issue Executive Orders. #SOTU Mr. President  let’s not be concerned if we offend our enemies  let's pay a whole lot more attention to how do we protect our people. #SOTU Mr. President  you must call the enemy out by name. It is impossible to defeat #ISIS if we do not call evil what it is &amp; act against it. Pres. Obama finally speaks about #ISIS but still won't admit that it's a Radical Islamic Terrorist movement that seeks to destroy us. #SOTU President Obama should be talking less about global warming and more about how we can defeat #ISIS and protect the homeland. #SOTU While President Obama is complaining about global warming 10 of our American sailors are held in Iranian custody. #SOTU President Obama says our biggest security threat is global warming -- not Radical Islamic Terrorists who have sworn to attack the U.S. #SOTU I agree Mr. President  we must cut red tape. But the fact is that you have created thousands of regulations creating more red tape. #SOTU Obama thinks education should be controlled by the federal government  I believe we must take the fed out of education. We must #ReviveEdu. When President Obama takes the stage tonight  there will still be 10 United States military members being held captive by #Iran. #SOTU BREAKING: While POTUS is preparing to talk about his so called "accomplishments"  10 of our American sailors are being held by #Iran. And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him  who have been called according to his purpose. We need a President who will stop threatening legal gun owners  and start tackling the root cause of violent crime in this county. We need a President who will stop threatening legal gun owners  &amp; start tackling the root causes of violent crime &amp; terrorism in this county Americans are rightly concerned when the same man who promised that you could keep your health care now promises that you can keep your guns A Muslim who accepts the tenets of Sharia Law is not compatible with the Constitution of the United States. https://t.co/IozjzS3eYy The President's actions have everything to do with advancing his political agenda &amp; little to do with actually protecting American citizens. Any executive order President Obama signs that regulates firearms transactions will merely regulate the freedom of law abiding citizens. Pres. Obama has told us to trust him on gun rights - just like "if you like your doctor  you can keep your doctor". https://t.co/uOrHqK1e0S We the People have a Constitutional right to bear arms and it is the President's responsibility to uphold that right. Let’s not get so concerned about how offended our enemies are and let’s pay a whole lot more attention to how do we protect our people. Strength is not determined by the decibels at which you say something but rather by the accomplishments in your life. If we don't recognize and address the seriousness of Radical Islamic Terrorism  eventually ISIS boots will be on OUR ground. https://t.co/QeIvyNaEsT Make common sense common again #NewYearsResolutionIn5Words I don’t accept money from billionaires or special-interest groups who want to influence me - I will not be bought and paid for. https://t.co/QsXF0uew2N Our system was not designed for career politicians. It was designed for citizen statesmen. We must put We the People back in charge. I think Teddy Roosevelt put it best in 1907... https://t.co/Nv1eIFsyj3 Why do I continue to run when the process has become so much about celebrity? Because our nation is worth saving and worth fighting for. Wishing a special Merry Christmas to all of our service men &amp; women protecting our nation who are unable to be with their families tonight. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior  who is Christ the Lord. -Luke 2:11 Candy and I want to wish you all a very Merry Christmas. For unto us a child is born. https://t.co/LAtzfPl6Vk https://t.co/TFCu0NEYDi My thoughts and prayers are with the family &amp; friends of the American service members who were killed in the suicide bombing in Afghanistan.

We honor the brave vets who served and those who continue their legacy. https://t.co/trfelkXqBE We should never sacrifice our values for the sake of political correctness. https://t.co/i3ziMPEPUZ We must eradicate #ISIS now. We have to use every means possible to do that. https://t.co/OS3nfeIUa4 I am thankful for those praying for God's guidance over this campaign -- both in person and around the country. https://t.co/1h6oeL5Pgu My thoughts and prayers are with the shooting victims and their families in San Bernardino. "There is nothing more precious than the life of a human being." #ProLife https://t.co/iDFRIZiZsv I leave Jordan knowing we need to get serious about ending the war in Syria. We need to stop whining and start winning. https://t.co/Bio46LzI73 I refuse to submit to political correctness -- there are too many people who gave up too much to protect our #1A. https://t.co/yxePkYs5vl https://t.co/MKUJUbaEAC https://t.co/q6fzD6tHXa If we don't have a way to monitor every foreign person entering this country  then we are being negligent in our duty to protect America. It remains foolish to think they are not trying to get here to hurt us. https://t.co/PMKnWo7vMd Thank you to @BobbyJindal for being a conservative governor and running a campaign he should be proud of. Wishing the Jindal family well. Talk is cheap. When we draw a line in the sand or boundary in the air  the world - most importantly #ISIS - needs to understand we mean it. The era of arm-chair quarterbacking our military will end in the Carson Administration. We must empower our military to destroy #ISIS. Tell Congress to defund the Obama Administration's plan to bring 10 000 Syrian refugees into America.

EPA rules by executive FIAT trying to kill an entire American industry and way of life (coal). 9.

Court ruled his NSA spying on every American was illegal. 6.  His copy of the bill of rights obviously goes from 1 to 3  skipping the 2nd amendment. 5.  Signed into law the indefinite detention of American citizens 4.  Fighting an undeclared  unconstitutional war in Syria  trying to put ISIS in Damascus. 3.  Fought an undeclared  unconstitutional war in Libya  turned it into Jihadist wonderland 2.  Thinks an executive order is legislation and how you make law 1.  Tried to take over 1/6 of economy in Obamacare  wrecked the system and hurt patients and taxpayers Today I would like to put a mirror in front of the Obama White House and show them the top ten things that make HIM unqualified: After 5 years of acting like a King and ignoring our constitution  that takes a lot of nerve. Yesterday the Obama White House had the nerve to say someone else was unqualified for office. Let’s be clear: disarming more law abiding citizens will not stop mass murderers and terrorists. https://t.co/b94MMcQvNI I've repeatedly said If you want to defeat ISIS  the first thing you have to do is quit supplying them with arms. https://t.co/kLrZpoXINf His administration is focused on gun laws that won't stop terrorists while pushing policies that will let more of them in the country. We should be advocating for more concealed carry ability for law abiding Americans and end to unconstitutional gun free zones. Let's be clear: disarming more law abiding citizens will not stop mass murderers and terrorists. The #Obamaspeech was an attempt to turn a necessary discussion on terrorism and national security into a ineffective gun control debate. This @NYDailyNews cover is deplorable.

The protection of religious liberty will be a cornerstone of a Romney-Ryan administration. http://t.co/dXwaucUH 52% of doctors say Obamacare will compel them to close or significantly restrict their practices to Medicare patients. #CantAfford4more Mitt crushed it again at tonight's debate! Contribute today. http://t.co/PFeQuLqt http://t.co/3aORgPnL .@BarackObama is right: "We've gone through a tough 4 years" We can't afford 4 more yrs like the last 4. Mitt will lead. #CantAfford4More At a time when America has a jobs crisis  wouldn’t it be nice to have a job creator in the White House? @MittRomney is ready to lead. Great conversation with @MittRomney. Proud to stand with Mitt tonight. http://t.co/KD7FCjAS Our national debt is increasing at a rate of more than $2 million every minute. #CantAfford4More Every American’s share of the national debt currently stands at over $51 000 – an Increase of over $16 000 under @BarackObama. Just to pay the interest on the debt that @BarackObama is racking up  a middle-class family would see its tax bill grow by $4K a year. President Obama has borrowed 31 cents of every dollar the federal government spent. #CantAfford4More .@BarackObama promised us that he would cut the deficit in half. Instead he’s run up trillion dollar deficits 4 years in a row. America is at a crossroads. We have a choice -- four more years of the same hardship and decline  or a new path.  #CantAfford4More There are 21 tax increases in Obamacare  12 hit the middle class. #CantAfford4More Obamacare is their signature achievement &amp; it is the most damaging. Higher premiums  higher taxes  restricted access &amp; broken promises. You deserve better. America can't afford 4 more years like the last. Donate now:  http://t.co/lKwvt7ZA http://t.co/XXYill6p We face a big choice. @BarackObama has had his chance &amp; made his choices. @MittRomney will deliver real reforms for a real recovery. Medicare and Social Security are promises that @MittRomney and I will honor. This is not what a real recovery looks like. Proud to stand w/ @MittRomney  who is uniquely qualified to get the job done. Let's get this done! http://t.co/mUy69XUc Great pep talk from one of my most trusted advisors. http://t.co/liskM5a5 Since @BarackObama took office  gas prices have risen by nearly $2 a gallon. #CantAfford4More http://t.co/RUjqvLl1 You can’t spend  tax  regulate and borrow your way to prosperity. #CantAfford4more Had a great conversation with @REALStaceyDash this afternoon. Thank you for your support! When @MittRomney is president  no one—friend or foe—will doubt America’s resolve. http://t.co/TYoyZ6HL Our plan for a stronger middle class will restore America as the best place in the world to find a job  start a business  or hire a worker. .@BarackObama has added almost as much publicly held debt as all 43 previous presidents combined. #CantAfford4More http://t.co/KsbW9r1k .@MittRomney defined the clear choice facing America. He is the man for the moment and will lead us to a real recovery. http://t.co/GoyjOKzZ The President's board of 15 bureaucrats to cut Medicare is indefensible. Proud to stand w/ @MittRomney as he offers a better solution. The greatest threat to Medicare is Obamacare. Our plan proposes no changes for those in or near retirement. #CantAfford4More A clear contrast: @MittRomney making the case for jobs and growth; @BarackObama committed to higher taxes. Keep up the great work  Mitt. In tonight's debate  we will see a clear choice between broken promises and bold leadership. @MittRomney is the right man to lead. .@Joebiden &amp; I agree: the middle class has been buried in the last 4 years. We need to stop digging by electing @MittRomney.#CantAfford4More .@BarackObama has raised taxes 21 times  and in a second term will raise taxes by another $2T. We can't afford four more years. This election is a choice. 4 more years of the same policies with the same results. Or we can put our country on a path to a real recovery. Since @BarackObama took office  debt per person has increased by more than $16 000. http://t.co/fzkA2vjk When China &amp; other foreign countries hold nearly half of our debt  America’s independence is threatened. http://t.co/AzJG79tK .@BarackObama has failed to address the crushing burden of debt  which stifles job creation today. http://t.co/Xl0Gj9GC We face a very clear choice in this election. Four more years of debt  doubt  decline or a real recovery to save the American Idea. America cannot afford four more years of @BarackObama’s failed policies. America needs a real recovery. If @BarackObama has admitted that he can’t change Washington  then we need to change presidents. We propose putting 50 million seniors  not 15 unaccountable bureaucrats  in charge of their own health-care decisions. The first step to a stronger Medicare is to repeal Obamacare. .@BarackObama took $716 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare – and seniors around the country will pay the price. The American free enterprise system has done more to help the poor than any other economic system ever designed. Every American’s share of the national debt currently stands at over $51 000 – an increase of over $16 000 under @BarackObama. On this somber day  our prayers go out to all Americans  especially those who’ve suffered from the senseless acts of eleven years ago today. 43 straight months of unemployment above 8%. This is not what a recovery looks like. Day 3 of the DNC and all we have heard are more excuses – but what the American people haven’t seen are results 47 million people are on food stamps today. That’s a record high. Are you better off than you were 4 years ago? Government works for us. Not the other way around. http://t.co/0Pj6Smq7 Americans deserve a president who gets it; a leader who understands we’re not better off  and who has a plan to fix the economy. We will not spend four years blaming others  we will take responsibility.  #RomneyRyan2012 It's time to return real leadership to the White House! Help @MittRomney reach 1 million followers before the DNC. RT &amp; let's get this done After four years of government trying to divide up the wealth  we will get America creating wealth again.  http://t.co/KoqHagmd We don’t have that much time.  But if we are serious  and smart  and we lead  we can do this. #RomneyRyan2012 .@MittRomney. Powerful speech! I'm excited for what lies ahead.  Let’s get this done. #RomneyRyan2012 We will not duck the tough issues  we will lead. #RomneyRyan2012  #BelieveInAmerica If you’re feeling left out or passed by: You have not failed  your leaders have failed you.  #RomneyRyan2012 The greatest threat to Medicare is Obamacare  and we’re going to stop it. #BelieveInAmerica The issue is not the economy as @BarackObama inherited it  not the economy as he envisions it  but as we are living it. #RomneyRyan2012 The work ahead will be hard.  These times demand the best of us – all of us  but we can do this. #RomneyRyan2012 .@BarackObama has no answer to this simple reality: We need to stop spending money we don’t have. #WeCanChangeIt .@BarackObama assumed office almost four years ago – isn’t it about time he assumed responsibility? #WeCanChangeIt The greatest threat to Medicare is Obamacare  and we’re going to stop it. #WeCanChangeIt http://t.co/2LG0hduG After four years of getting the run-around  America needs a turnaround  and the man for the job is @MittRomney. #WeCanChangeIt We’re not just picking the next president. We are picking the pathway for America for a generation. In 2008  @BarackObama opposed cuts to Medicare  yet as president  he cut Medicare by $716b to pay for Obamacare. Washington has been too concerned about the next election and not enough about the next generation  and that has to end. Unemployment has been above 8% for 42 months and over 23 million people are struggling for work. This is Pres. Obama’s imaginary recovery. President Obama treated Medicare like a piggy bank  raiding $716 billion from it to fund Obamacare. His campaign calls that an ‘achievement’ President Obama treated Medicare like a piggy bank to fund Obamacare; as a result  nearly 1 out of 6 hospitals &amp; nursing homes will close. .@BarackObama has been talking about Medicare. We want this debate. We need this debate. We will win this debate. Medicare should not be used as a piggy bank for Obamacare. Medicare should be the promise that is kept to current seniors. Period. We have a lot of energy in the country; let's use that energy. Energy independence. That helps the economy. It creates jobs.  #tcot .@BarackObama cut $716b from Medicare to fund Obamacare. We offer a plan to save  protect &amp; strengthen Medicare http://t.co/3vbRPT02 RT @MittRomney: If your priority is creating more jobs and putting more people to work  that's what we know how to do. #RomneyRyan2012 I'm honored to join @MittRomney on America's Comeback Team. http://t.co/8gid73By #RomneyRyan2012 The Obama-Clinton failed ISIS strategy: ISIS attacks our allies.

ICYMI:  "NJ can't wait on reforming public-sector benefits"  http://t.co/q6Rcorsrdh Here is the Comission's full list of proposals I’ve endorsed: http://t.co/VdztXzQbOi #ForOurFuture And a constitutional amendment for steady payments from the state is a starting point. #ForOurFuture We have more work to do together  but pension freeze  a new planned structure… (cont.) Here is the Roadmap to Reform we signed with the NJEA  http://t.co/zGUsQjCPn2 #ForOurFuture …by providing tax relief and new jobs which lead to fulfilling careers. We will miss the opportunity to boost take home pay for working class taxpayers… …to become valued and contributing members of the community… We will miss the opportunity to give our young children the chance to be successful with a quality education no matter where they live… Sometimes it doesn’t seem immediately apparent  but this problem is eating us away little by little. That someone else will pay.  You know that is not true. They will tell you that it won’t impact you  and that it’s going to be somebody else’s problem. They will tell you that this will just go away if we ignore it.  They will tell you that this is solvable if we just raise takes. There are politicians  some of whom may be in this very room  who will tell you that we don’t need further pension and health benefit reform We now have a bipartisan reform plan which can  once and for all  fix this problem. We acted in 2011 to acknowledge and to begin to repair this serious problem. I have stood behind this podium for five years speaking about this problem candidly and openly. Watch Budget Address LIVE here: https://t.co/BRxEBWyHQl Thats great. Where are you guys? RT @gmarnin: @GovChristie I put the kids to work.

My take here: http://t.co/XrUx3mJLRv http://t.co/aI6Ccn7tQE Well  I certainly didn't learn anything new from this speech. Whether it be Rebs or Dems - never expressing the concerns of the constitution But fighting these wars in the middle east has had nothing to do with promoting our freedom. -RP #SOTU He should be thanking Edward #Snowden for bringing this to the attention of American people! - RP #SOTU Looks like the global war on terror will continue w/ troops remaining in over 100 countries - this is where our problem is. - RP #SOTU The terrorists want to attack us because we are still killing civilians with drones… - RP There is no constitutional authority that our govt. should manage healthcare for the entire population. - RP #SOTU But how many millions have lost their insurance since Obamacare went into effect?? - RP Pres. Obama is talking like a true authoritarian when he talks of setting wages. This totally rejects the ideas of a free society. - RP So far all we have heard is that we need more govt. spending - yet that is the problem that we are facing. -RP As far as I am concerned  the Pres. is making a great case for homeschooling. - RP You subsidize unemployment - you get more of it. - RP #SOTU A deeply flawed educational system has led to a labor market that is not skilled. -RP This speech sounds like more and more and more government and govt. is the problem. - RP The only real solution is to get rid of the income tax and repeal the 16th amendment. - RP #SOTU Education is not a responsibility of the Fed. govt. It is a responsibility of parents. -RP Why don't we just follow the Constitution?We would know what the proper size of govt. would be. - RP This speech we are about to hear is not about the SOTU  it is a political speech directed to the American people. -RP Take a moment to write a note to Edward #Snowden. Ron will make sure it gets to him directly. http://t.co/I7XeyREwtJ http://t.co/Ap4NSyqCRw Thank you for waking us up  Edward #Snowden.

I LOVE what community health centers do. https://t.co/g3BeJBHhhX We should never cower to fear by turning against our neighbors or by rejecting our values. Terrorists must have no place to run &amp; hide  but we must also remember that terrorists commit acts of violence to paralyze &amp; divide us. Our job is to work closely with our allies around the world to fight terrorism wherever it occurs. America stands with the people of Brussels  the victims &amp; families of those killed &amp; injured  &amp; the city’s heroic first responders. If only getting folks to do the right thing were this easy in Washington. #summershack  #youmadetherightchoice https://t.co/H6O4a2kLby It’s my hope all Senators will show that they respect the President  the Constitution  &amp; Judge Garland enough to do the same. #SCOTUSnominee I look forward to meeting with Judge Garland  reviewing his record closely  coming to a decision &amp; then voting. #SCOTUSnominee .@POTUS has done his job selecting a nominee &amp; sending that nominee to the Senate. It’s time for the Senate to do its job. #SCOTUSnominee Along the way  he’s won praise from Dem &amp; GOP Senators  liberals &amp; conservatives – even the SCOTUS Chief Justice. #SCOTUSnominee Judge Merrick Garland has served his country with distinction – as a prosecutor  DOJ official  &amp; DC Circuit judge. #SCOTUSnominee I joined colleagues &amp; Hamilton's @Lin_Manuel to urge action so #PuertoRico can restructure its debt. #PRDayofAction https://t.co/czvfYet8ZL If PR were a country  it could go to the IMF. If it were a city  it could declare bankruptcy. It can do neither because of Congress. After 10 yrs of recession  #PuertoRico is in a terrible hole of debt with vulture funds trying to squeeze every last drop. #PRDayofAction Secretary of Ed is one of the toughest jobs  because for yrs @usedgov has put student loan companies &amp; for-profit colleges before students. .@ElizabethBanks isn't from District 12 or the Capitol  she's from Pittsfield! Great to see her (&amp; @Americans4Arts). https://t.co/XRbS5k1AC5 Today groups delivered 800k petition signatures to @SenateMajLdr’s office - urging a vote on the #SAVEBenefits Act. https://t.co/F19uymKJhA Watch my new floor speech telling the @Senate_GOPs: #doyourjob &amp; consider a SCOTUS nominee: https://t.co/UdPOJ8bayc The game's over. If @Senate_GOPs want to stand up to extremist candidates  they can start by standing up to extremists in the Senate. .@Senate_GOPs want to play it both ways: rejecting @POTUS’s legitimacy and crippling the govt while claiming Rs can govern responsibly. At the same time they’re blocking any SCOTUS nominee  @Senate_GOPs are in a panic that their party will nominate an extremist for President. Glad to intro @RepJoeKennedy's bill in the Sen to strengthen accountability &amp; give consumers better tools for info.  https://t.co/oIYolosPr9 Another sign the bipartisan chorus is growing to make sure Wall Street fund managers pay their fair share: https://t.co/J6sRgItlai Read my new @TalkPoverty op-ed on why we need the #SAVEBenefits Act to give seniors &amp; vets a SS raise: https://t.co/TZsHxz9LiQ Any conversation about tackling poverty in the US should include protecting &amp; expanding Social Security. The @CFPB should move soon &amp; robustly on its new rules for payday lenders. No delays  and no carve-outs. The @CFPB is doing a great job to crack down on the tricks &amp; traps in payday loans. Congress should back the @CFPB  not sabotage it. Until the @CFPB  no federal agency was responsible for overseeing payday lenders  who can stick vulnerable people with rates up to 400%. 2.5 million households borrow from payday lenders each year  with more storefronts in the US than McDonald’s and Starbucks combined. FMLA was a huge step fwd  and we must do more. Read my @BostonGlobe op-ed on how to level the playing field: https://t.co/uRk48gJvkM We need real agency reform to level the playing field - not to give lobbyists more chances to block outcomes they don’t like. Today I joined the @SenateDems at the Supreme Court to tell the GOP: #DoYourJob on a #SCOTUS nominee. https://t.co/hVjX9KfnYj Medical experts agree: Whatever you think of medical marijuana  it's  irresponsible not to study the science:  https://t.co/VTgRzoLmOr Serious medical research on medical marijuana is largely blocked by outdated federal laws &amp; policies. Medical marijuana might be a viable alternative to opioids for pain treatment  but truthfully  there's a lot we just don't know. Wishing my very best for a speedy recovery to one of the Senate’s toughest fighters  @clairecmc. The whole Twitterverse is here for you! Abandoning their Senate duties would also prove that all the Republican talk about loving the Constitution is just that – empty talk. The Senate GOP took an oath just like Dems did. Abandoning the duties they swore to uphold threatens the Constitution &amp; our democracy. I can’t find a clause in the Constitution that says “…except when there’s a year left in the term of a Democratic President.” Art II Sec 2 of the Constitution says the President nominates Supreme Court justices with the advice &amp; consent of the Senate. .@SenateMajLdr is right that Americans should have a voice in selecting the next SCOTUS justice. In fact  they did: when @POTUS won in 2012. The sudden death of Justice Scalia creates an immediate vacancy on the most important court in the United States. .@RepCummings &amp; I sent a letter to @USDOL about advisors’ wildly conflicting messages on a conflict of interest rule https://t.co/U7y9ZoFrxi But when these retirement advisors talk to their own stockholders  the doomsday predictions disappear &amp; the companies say they’ll be fine. Financial companies have predicted dire consequences from a new rule requiring them to act in customers’ best interests. I won't support more "innovation" proposals until we have a bipartisan agreement to strengthen @US_FDA &amp; seriously fund medical research. Big medical breakthroughs come from basic research. Instead of funding that research  Congress has spent a decade choking off support. On #FMLA23  we remember how much more we need to do to level the playing field for workers &amp; families. https://t.co/JRqeMniImE On #GoRedForWomen Day  I’m fighting to double NIH funding to help millions of women live longer  healthier lives. https://t.co/EoYuUTo0Zl If we want strong enforcement  personnel is policy. Read Commissioner Bowen’s call for tougher Wall St enforcement: https://t.co/sm3QxIsEFA Every single House Republican who came to work today just voted to make it harder to hold big banks accountable for fraud. Shameful. Tell Congress: They work for the American people — not Wall Street banks that break the law. Vote NO on HR 766. You read that right: The House is just minutes away from voting on a bill to make it tougher to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud. Nope — right now on the House floor  Wall St buddies are pushing a bill to make it tougher to prosecute bank fraud. You’d think big banks would be happy with enforcement so tepid that they could just bake fines into the cost of doing business  right? Systematic fraud on Wall St helped spark the 2008 financial crisis – but not a single Wall St executive went to jail. If anyone in Congress thinks they can make it harder to crack down on corporate criminals  I promise you: The American people are watching. Today I spoke on the Senate floor about our rigged justice system for the rich &amp; powerful. Watch: https://t.co/NWX8Et2hqA The American people remember who broke our economy &amp; who made out like bandits – and they didn’t send us here to help the bandits. Want to see the rigged game in action? Tomorrow  the House will vote on a GOP bill to make it harder to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud. It’s not equal justice when a kid gets thrown in jail for stealing a car  while a CEO gets a huge raise when his company steals billions. We have one set of law on the books  but two legal systems: One for the rich &amp; powerful  and one for everyone else. Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss my enforcement report &amp; GOP efforts to weaken Wall St accountability: https://t.co/fbMGC9EVjR Today I urged Congress to reject the #TPP deal before it makes things even worse for America’s families: https://t.co/h339ZKInfy Congress will have to vote straight up or down on #TPP.  We won’t have a chance to strip out any of the worst provisions  like ISDS. A rigged process produces a rigged outcome. Evidence of this tilt can be seen in a key #TPP provision: ISDS. 12 countries will sign the #TPP trade deal on Thursday - but it won't go into effect unless Congress approves it. Today I asked the Senate GOP: If you won't support #InTheRed  then what's your plan for student loan debt? https://t.co/kIjPpgSgRy The next president can honor the simple notion that nobody is above the law  but it will happen only if voters demand it. Read my new @nytimes op-ed about how personnel is policy for enforcing federal laws: https://t.co/BZZSpjm7VS Today my office released a report on 20 of the worst federal enforcement failures in 2015: https://t.co/u0R2JX1BNd Presidents don’t control most day-to-day enforcement decisions  but they do nominate heads of agencies. That makes all the difference. Much of the attention on DC focuses on enacting laws  but a law that's not enforced may as well not even be a law at all. 2016 candidates are pitching their legislative agendas  but voters should consider what presidents can do without Congress. I don’t love Wall St bankers who break our economy – but I LOVED #TheBigShort. Great to meet @GhostPanther today! https://t.co/l8cNe1gZ17 Yesterday  @SenateDems announced our new #InTheRed campaign to help students getting crushed with debt. https://t.co/kQ2zexKehN This Congress doesn’t lack workable ideas for how to root out the influence of money in politics; it just lacks the spine to do them. Here’s a whole list of things Congress could do if we had the courage to stand up to the super-wealthy few: https://t.co/xjGe3EzdgA We can – and we should – blame the Supreme Court for #CitizensUnited. But that is no excuse for doing nothing. Money floods our political system  letting a handful of billionaires shape who gets into Congress &amp; may decide who sits in the White House. Six years ago today  #CitizensUnited turned loose a flood of hidden money that is about to drown our democracy. .@POTUS &amp; the @SenateDems are fighting for students &amp; families #InTheRed. It’s long past time for the GOP leadership to join us. I’d like for you to meet my #SOTU guest: Alexis  a 1st generation college student at @UMassLowell. #InTheRed https://t.co/AkbYQhcUI7 This #KeystoneXL lawsuit shows: ISDS was a bad idea for NAFTA  and it’s a bad idea for TPP. https://t.co/JgmCXPEge8 I strongly support @POTUS’s action to #stopgunviolence. If Congress won’t step up to keep our kids safe  somebody else needs to start. Gun violence is an epidemic. But day after day  tragedy after tragedy  the GOP has blocked even the smallest steps to #stopgunviolence. Glad to join Senate cafeteria workers for their Wednesday #brownbagboycott to fight for a union &amp; higher wages. https://t.co/jSvgUi18Hb Tell your Senators: They weren't sent to Washington to carry water for Wall Street. https://t.co/mgwXPhpKVZ Wall St lobbyists know they can't roll back financial regulations out in the public  so they tack them onto must-pass pieces of legislation. We hand out tax breaks to big corps  but millions of working families will be plunged into poverty if we don’t extend their tax breaks too. It is shameful that in 2015  in the richest country on Earth  millions of kids are growing up in abject poverty. #childpoverty Let me spell it out loud &amp; clear  GOP: If you try to defund @PPFA  we’ll fight you every step of the way - &amp; win. https://t.co/vY8723wcnZ Heading back to the Senate floor right now to talk about @PPFA funding. I cannot believe I have to do this again. https://t.co/0aSxs8OGT2 On World AIDS Day  let's recommit to funding medical research for more breakthroughs &amp; healthier families around the world. #WAD2015 1 month from today  seniors &amp; veterans won't be receiving a Social Security cost of living increase. #SAVEBenefits https://t.co/9Y9AWMDv1z Today I joined @EconomicPolicy to release their powerful #workforwomen agenda. Learn more: https://t.co/WkMjn1WfLD https://t.co/QMACpZ6bDo It's time to reform the tax code  but let's do it right. Here are 3 guiding principles. #npclive https://t.co/BjCwV4bgEv Last month I traveled to Europe to see the Syrian refugee crisis up close. Today I spoke about what I saw: https://t.co/wvUFehtGY0 If anyone thinks they can slip Wall St goodies into the funding bills without a fight  they are very wrong: https://t.co/T0ho8CaQcf Thank you @POTUS for rejecting #KeystoneXL - &amp; thanks to the many people from MA &amp; nationwide who fought for this big day to happen. Closing the CEO performance pay tax loophole would give every senior on SS a $581 check next year – with $ left over. #SAVEBenefits For seniors &amp; vets living on Social Security  an extra $581 next year from the #SAVEBenefits Act would mean a lot. https://t.co/Oaf0HXYgNg CEOs got a 3.9% pay raise last year. Let’s give seniors  vets  and the disabled on Social Security a 1-time 3.9% boost too. #SAVEBenefits 70 million people won’t get a SS cost of living increase on Jan 1. That’s why I’m sponsoring the #SAVEBenefits Act. https://t.co/ol1GAEJA0E I support the @WhiteHouse’s executive order to #BanTheBox on federal job apps. A criminal record shouldn’t mean a life sentence of poverty. House Democrats must stand strong tomorrow &amp; fight GOP efforts to weaken oversight of big financial firms: https://t.co/S3zfJyX44B I support @SenBlumenthal’s Background Check Completion Act. It's time to fix our broken gun background check system. https://t.co/zqrNqlQ5As Standardized testing has gone too far in many places. I support the @WhiteHouse’s call to limit overburdensome tests https://t.co/Rney153ntj .@PRyan Family time should not be a privilege reserved for the Speaker of the House. You deserve it – and so does everyone else. .@PRyan That's why Dems are fighting for paid sick time  family leave &amp; schedules that work - bills your party repeatedly blocks. Millions of hard-working moms &amp; dads want work/life balance too @PRyan - but can be fired just asking for time off to care for a sick kid. I'm glad to see @PRyan understands the importance of work/life balance for his next job. The @SenateDems are calling on the GOP to support 3 measures to #StopGunViolence &amp; keep our kids safe. Watch: https://t.co/C0qpMYJz7n Thank you  @deray. This is important.  https://t.co/oscXnqbDKy Our office joined the #PinkOut to #StandWithPP. We won't let the GOP shut down the gov to defund women's healthcare. http://t.co/lSbIZsOpAw Last night I spoke at the @emkinstitute about fighting racial injustice in America. Please watch: https://t.co/C50VzeggU8 #BlackLivesMatter Spoke last night about the GOP’s 20-wk abortion ban – a terrible right-wing assault on women. Watch: https://t.co/8LykaNjxLu #StopTheBans "I urge my colleagues to vote no on this terrible bill. Stand up to this assault on women &amp; families." #StopTheBans http://t.co/ivZ5QshmFA “We have lived in an America where women died in back alley abortions… and we are NOT going back. Not now  not ever.” #StopTheBans “But then I saw the bill we’re voting on tomorrow and I felt sick to my stomach.” #StopTheBans http://t.co/XzuLeZJk92 “I didn’t think the GOP leadership could sink any lower than trying to defund cancer screenings &amp; access to birth control.” #StopTheBans On my way to the Senate floor now to discuss the horrifying 20-week abortion ban bill the GOP wants us to vote on tomorrow.  #StopTheBans It shouldn’t take Jon Stewart at the Capitol for Congress to give those who served &amp; sacrificed on 9/11 the care they need. #renew911health Happy 80th birthday  @SocialSecurity! http://t.co/Faeg635GeA On the 50th anniversary of the VRA  we remember: Voting rights are civil rights. It’s time to #RestoreTheVRA. http://t.co/no70eMY2Xe Today I reintroduced my bill to stop employers from requiring credit checks on prospective employees. http://t.co/SADUlygA8Y Lots of people have damaged credit from a job loss  illness  or family breakup. It has no correlation with one's ability to succeed at work. The GOP plan to defund @PPFA is a right-wing attack on women’s rights. Watch why I voted to #StandwithPP: https://t.co/QdJD6dlTum "The GOP plan to defund @PPFA is a GOP plan to defund women’s health care. I #standwithPP – and I hope my colleagues will do the same." "Women have lived through a world where backward-looking ideologues tried to interfere in basic health decisions  &amp; we’re not going back." "A vote to defund @PPFA is a vote to defund cancer screenings &amp; birth control &amp; basic health care for millions of women." #StandwithPP "To be clear: Even though the abortions performed at @PPFA are safe &amp; legal  the federal gov isn't paying for them." http://t.co/8KthIa9PnB “Why do so many people use @PPFA? Because they are nonprofit &amp; they are open.” #StandwithPP http://t.co/cx8OVSXkum “No one may mention it at Thanksgiving or post it on FB for the world to know  but look at the facts.” #StandwithPP http://t.co/ObjLPankgu “The GOP vote to defund @PPFA is 1 more piece of a deliberate  methodical  orchestrated right-wing attack on women’s rights.” #StandwithPP “Because I cannot believe that in 2015  the US Senate would be spending its time trying to defund women’s health care centers.” #StandwithPP “I come to the Sen. floor today to ask my GOP colleagues: Do you have any idea what year it is?” #StandwithPP I’m heading to the Senator floor soon to #StandwithPP. Watch live or follow here on Twitter for updates.  http://t.co/Ai7mydjESc I #StandWithPP for my daughter  my granddaughters &amp; women of MA. We will NOT let the Senate GOP defund @PPFA &amp; deny women basic healthcare. Diplomacy is our best hope of ending the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran  far better than the alternative of escalating tensions &amp; war. .@SenJohnMcCain  @SenatorCantwell  @SenAngusKing &amp; I reintroduced the 21st Century Glass Steagall Act. Watch: https://t.co/mqguGSjYAv We need to rebuild the wall between boring commercial banking – checking &amp; savings accounts - &amp; riskier investment banking. Wall St’s bets brought our economy to its knees - &amp; today the big banks are bigger than when they were declared “too big to fail” 7 yrs ago. Heading to the Senate floor to reintroduce the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to reduce taxpayers’ risk in the financial system. Tune in! Chief Justice Roberts was wrong: Marriage equality has everything to do with the Constitution. Read my @TIME op-ed: http://t.co/vsmelqz46N What a party for marriage equality at the MA State House! Here's my view from the podium. #LoveWins #WickedProud http://t.co/Z0A1OSTZZr Woo-hoo! Love wins!!!  #lovewins On World Blood Donor Day  we remember: Blood donor constraints should be based on science &amp; risk  not sexual orientation. #GiveBlood "I believe that we can - and we must - make college affordable for every hard-working kid who wants to get an education. It’s up to us." “If we drown our young people in debt  we drown America's future.” #affordablecollege http://t.co/jRMvuuawJU “The federal gov should not profit from student loans – period.” #affordablecollege http://t.co/DhRFDVE9FJ I’m #wearingorange for National Gun Violence Awareness Day. We owe it to our kids to stop the violence. http://t.co/n3V6e6evZL Disappointed by the TPA vote. I hope the House will carefully scrutinize this deal &amp; demand TPP be made public before a Fast Track vote. If TPP supporters are sure that the deal is good for working families  why are they so afraid of letting you see it? https://t.co/TtPIOSTiUu This isn't accountability for Wall Street. It's business as usual  and it stinks. http://t.co/wdUBHHHrqT Trade deal supporters have said again &amp; again they would protect workers. The facts show decades of broken promises: http://t.co/rnPsyRvaxF The GOP’s values aren’t America’s values. I’m standing up for our values by voting against this terrible budget. http://t.co/HB3KAVBRKl When government agencies reach settlements with companies that break the law  they should disclose the terms to the public. Today at the Supreme Court &amp; every day  we remember:  #LoveCantWait #LoveMustWin http://t.co/SVThRKwXCv Today  @SenSherrodBrown &amp; I sent a letter to the @WhiteHouse  urging President Obama to declassify the TPP agreement. http://t.co/waYMJRLKk2 Big oil gets big subsidies - money we could use for STEM education or clean energy infrastructure. #EarthDay reminds us we have work to do. The secret to better markets isn't turning banks loose - it's forcing everyone to play by the same rules. Watch: http://t.co/GIQ2EdRTJz Raising the minimum wage is about economics  but it's also about our values. Nobody who works full time should live in poverty. #FightFor15 “First  financial institutions shouldn’t be allowed to cheat people.” http://t.co/U1RSzcli0c “Republicans claim – loudly &amp; repeatedly – they support competitive markets  but their approach to financial reg is pure crony capitalism.” Last year every GOP senator voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act. It's long past time for #EqualPayNow. http://t.co/nabrmFVbIg The big banks might not like following basic rules that protect consumers – but we weren't sent here to work for them. I’m wearing blue for World Autism Awareness Day – and fighting to increase NIH funding for autism research. #LIUB http://t.co/VeFg1ijNQJ 2/3 of seniors rely on Social Security for most of their income. The budget reflects our values - let's honor our promises to our seniors. Just introduced an amendment with Senators Manchin  Murray  Brown &amp; Schatz to strengthen &amp; expand Social Security. http://t.co/cwRUT6TjP6 Americans want tougher rules &amp; more accountability on Wall Street – not the GOP’s #bailoutbudget. http://t.co/tWmKjQEp7F Our budget should reflect our values  so I’m introducing a budget amendment to refi student loans to 2013 rates. http://t.co/cvPlOO1JyR Here's some real #MarchMadness for the millions of people struggling with student loan debt. #bankonstudents http://t.co/GdS5uCblwZ 100+ law profs agree: A #TPP trade deal with ISDS would undermine US sovereignty. Watch my floor speech why: https://t.co/OIq4L8TnWe Honored to spend the day w/ @repjohnlewis  a man who changed history. We carry his memories in our hearts. #Selma50 http://t.co/ONgvIOdR7U It's up to us to make sure our government serves ALL of our people. We must restore the #VotingRightsAct. #Selma50 http://t.co/NZpYsrBsMa Today we listen  we remember  and we continue the fight. #Selma50 #MarchOn http://t.co/GWgO1XcXRN Proud to file a SCOTUS brief for marriage equality w/ 43 other senators because #LoveCantWait. http://t.co/YKTE3iXMlN http://t.co/Y0LESXqXLn The FCC did the right thing by adopting strong rules for a free &amp; open Internet. This is a huge victory for the little guys. #NetNeutrality Letting foreign companies challenge US laws under the TPP agreement without stepping in US court is a bad deal. Read: http://t.co/QDlO6meqoU My GOP colleagues: You control Congress. Don't just start talking about helping the middle class – start doing it. http://t.co/IaHqnzmVV0 The GOP's made-up Social Security crisis threatens income for millions - including over 200k in MA. Tell the GOP: No Social Security cuts. Vaccines are safe  effective  &amp; our best chance to protect children from diseases that can kill them. Watch: http://t.co/OLTjpTlA9V Protecting waterways should be a bipartisan issue. We can’t let the GOP block the @EPA’s rule. http://t.co/5NMO3r2cNz  #ProtectCleanWater The GOP has manufactured a homeland security crisis. Let’s quit playing games with DHS &amp; pass a clean bill. #DontShutDownOurSecurity I'm still committed to reversing #CitizensUnited. We don't run this country for corporations  we run it for people. http://t.co/a0EopAhqLR Great speech  Mr. President. Looking forward to working with the @WhiteHouse to build an economy that works for all our families. #SOTU The @WhiteHouse is right: Medical research is good for people &amp; good for our economy. That’s how to build a stronger future. #SOTU Now's the time to let people refinance their student loans. Thank you @WhiteHouse for supporting our #BankOnStudents bill. #SOTU Raising the minimum wage isn’t just about economics – it’s about our values. @WhiteHouse  Congress: let’s finally do this. #SOTU “This country does best when everyone gets their fair shot  everyone does their fair share &amp; everyone plays by the same set of rules." #SOTU Thank you @WhiteHouse for your commitment to protecting Wall Street reform. The big banks don’t need another giveaway. #SOTU The game is rigged when people pay higher taxes working for money than inheriting it. I support @barackobama's plan: http://t.co/K6doBCP9JK No one should have to pick between having a child &amp; paying her bills. I’m joining @BarackObama to #LeadOnLeave.  http://t.co/Ft7Wm5RpPB Why is #Keystone the GOP’s top priority? Money and power. http://t.co/iNDR45bfmd Great work by @NancyPelosi  @MaxineWaters &amp; the House Dems to block the GOP from delaying the Volcker Rule for the biggest Wall St banks! This is ridiculous. 233k people in MA receive Social Security disability benefits that could be threatened by these political games. The GOP is inventing a Social Security crisis that will threaten benefits for millions &amp; put our most vulnerable at risk. The FDA must commit to building a bigger  safer blood supply through risk-based screening &amp; have courage to set policies based on science. The new #FDA blood donation policy is a step forward  but it is still a lifetime ban for many gay Americans &amp; still discriminatory. Congrats to our new Surgeon General  Dr. Vivek Murthy -- a physician &amp; instructor at @BrighamWomens &amp; @harvardmed. MA is proud of you! In case you missed it  watch the speech I gave Fri night about the powerful influence of Citigroup in Washington: http://t.co/YPQ1VwOSX7 Congress proved tonight that if you're a Wall Street bank  Washington works great for you. We lost this time but we keep fighting. We were sent to Washington to work for the American people  not Citigroup. Watch the floor speech I just gave here: http://t.co/YPQ1VwOSX7 Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss Citigroup's bailout provision. Citigroup is holding government funding hostage to ram through its government bailout provision. Join me in opposing the #CitigroupShutdown Report: Burger King will dodge up to $1.2 billion in taxes with its move to Canada http://t.co/309Du4qo8q. Antonio Weiss played a key role. Congress shouldn't support the budget package until the Wall Street giveaway is removed. Watch &amp; share ASAP: http://t.co/ZDr5rIhppe The #TortureReport is deeply troubling. Transparency is the first step toward accountability — we must always live up to our moral values. I support @barackobama’s decision on #ImmigrationAction. If House Republicans won’t do their jobs  it’s time for the President to do his. I was proud to vote for comprehensive #immigration reform in the Senate  but House Republicans have refused a vote for over a year. .@Walmart  America's largest employer  can &amp; should lead on the #minimumwage  #equalpay &amp; #schedulesthatwork. It's about economics &amp; values. I support #schedulesthatwork to give hourly employees more flexibility &amp; certainty at work. http://t.co/4WDR6VUZkg .@SenatorReid asked me to join the caucus leadership as Strategic Policy Advisor.

We should all take time today to pay tribute to the victims of 9/11  their families &amp; the troops who've kept us safe. #NeverForget Trumps demeaning remarks are small and inappropriate for anyone  much less a presidential candidate.

Wish somebody had thought of price cap idea earlier... #InternationalWomensDay moment to celebrate progress in fight for true equality but acknowledge how far we have to go. #IWD2016 For jobs  strategic influence in the world and an outward looking Britain  we need to remain in the European Union. #EUreferendum Really sad to hear about Alan Rickman. Brilliant actor  deeply principled man. My heart goes out to Rima and his family. Closure of UK's last deep mine is a moment to remember the incredible sacrifices of the miners and the solidarity of our pit communities. Truth is that homelessness is getting worse again. Terrible  because it can be tackled ---and was---by the last Labour government. Attempts to demonise and target MPs over Syria by some who claim to be our supporters are intolerable and have no place in the Labour party. I will be opposing the government motion on Syria tonight. My statement to to my constituency explains why.https://t.co/xjrf8Zc1vj The UK should write zero emissions into law.

The challenge for the Chancellor is that he claimed the mantle of One Nation. But @TheIFS figures suggest a profoundly regressive Budget. scraps relative child poverty target. Serious question to those on the right? Of course  opportunity matters but so obviously does income.

Best wishes to all those at #PrideinLondon today. Thank-you to all of our brave men and women and their families for their bravery  sacrifice and service for our country. #ArmedForcesDay Attacks in Tunisia and elsewhere are horrific. My heart goes out to all those caught up in them. Walk onto holborn tube escalator. Man shouts ' oh my god it's Nick Clegg'... Hmmm not exactly Currently having lunch with the brilliant founder of #milifandom @twcuddleston to say thanks for starting something so highly improbable... In 2006  he said in his Scarman lecture  "Poverty is relative – and those who pretend otherwise are wrong".Today he says its "absurd" (2/2) The PM's One Nation speech feels like a weak attempt to explain why it is OK to cut tax credits and say you stand for working people (1/2). John Cridland's speech today is important and he is right. We have an outdated exam system  designed for a different age. It should change. Stark contrast: Pope calls for action on climate change  govt pulls plug on onshore wind  raising energy bills and undermining industry Earlier I spoke in the Queen’s Speech debate about one nation and inequality.

They are a credit to our party  and  driven by a passion to serve  they are a credit to our country. This has clearly been a very disappointing and difficult night for the Labour party. To every member and supporter  I want to say thank you. We won't know the result for a while but I want to say thank you to people who knocked on doors &amp; everyone who voted. http://t.co/cuuw6daHIO This evening  you can vote to build a Britain that succeeds because working people succeed.

Thank you to every supporter out there making the case for Labour today.

Today is the day we can change Britain. I’ve just voted in Doncaster. Today isn’t a day to vote simply for Labour but to vote for yourself &amp; for your family http://t.co/SyhjnkOcls Today you can vote for a Labour government that stands up for working people  you can vote to put your NHS &amp; your family first. #VoteLabour I'm not asking you to vote simply for Labour tomorrow.

I am going to stand up for working people if I am Prime Minister. We are absolutely clear what we'll do → http://t.co/ILkgIXDI7q Last night I was at a hospital in Ilkeston.

I hope the Duke &amp; Duchess of Cambridge are enjoying her first  special days. I'm glad I persuaded @rustyrockets that voting is important…and he’s telling people to vote Labour. Watch here: https://t.co/sbMW5SrToB The future of the NHS is at risk. If the Tories win there will be a drive for more privatisation &amp; more people waiting longer for treatment. It’s really great to have Steve Coogan backing Labour in this election - watch his video explaining why → https://t.co/b0aD0JjJIL The future of your family and your NHS are on the ballot paper on Thursday. Read my piece for the Mirror today → http://t.co/VPBHOtodbf Five years ago Nick Clegg promised to scrap tuition fees but he then trebled them. I’ve said I will cut tuition fees. I won’t break my word. I believe in a Britain which is fairer  stronger  more prosperous  more equal &amp; more just. If you do too  join us: http://t.co/5qRcyLL0dt I took some time out of the campaign to play pool against Ronnie O’Sullivan. I went easy on him… https://t.co/8qp37tA51n Congratulations to the Duke and Duchess on the birth of their daughter. Wishing them lots of joy and happiness - and hopefully some sleep! Last night  David Cameron was asked if he is planning to cut Child Benefit. He used 600 words to dodge answering  but he didn’t say no. I will make sure the deficit is cut every year. I will put working families first. I will fight every day for you as your PM. #bbcqt I want to be completely clear: there will no coalition and no deals with the SNP. #bbcqt Thanks for the questions on #bbcqt. There’s a clear choice. Cameron didn’t rule out cutting child benefit. I’ll put working families first. There’s no question the Tories will cut child benefit if they win  the only question is will David Cameron be honest about it tonight #BBCQT The choice:  →child benefit and tax credits protected by Labour →child benefit and tax credits slashed by the Tories http://t.co/tWOq768QdX The Tories' secret plan to cut child benefit &amp; tax credits has been revealed. Working families can't afford five years of the Tories. The Tories have drawn up plans to take thousands of pounds from millions of families. Child benefit &amp; tax credits are on the ballot paper. What I said to @rustyrockets: we have the NHS  equal pay laws  LGBT rights because people voted for change. https://t.co/MX0R3Lfuay Watch my interview with @rustyrockets where I tell him that voting can make change happen → https://t.co/MX0R3Lfuay David Cameron won't guarantee the future of tax credits for working families but he will guarantee that non-doms can carry on avoiding tax. This election is your chance to change the way our country is run so it doesn’t put the most powerful first but puts working families first. Britain only succeeds when working people succeed. On workers' memorial day my message is Labour will act to make workplaces safer. #IWMD15 For the first three years of the next Labour government  we will abolish stamp duty for all first time buyers of homes under £300 000. We’ll cap rents so they can’t rise faster than inflation during a three-year tenancy. Read more about it here → http://t.co/CdFWJiKntF People who rent deserve better than this Tory government. I have a better plan to help → http://t.co/nR9PxHkR4P The awful scenes in Nepal are heartbreaking. My thoughts go out to the people affected  and to those caring for survivors. You can't trust the Tories with the NHS  because you can't save the NHS with an IOU. http://t.co/kb7bMrFB92 Next month  we can start building an NHS with time to care. This is how we'll rescue the NHS: http://t.co/qTb4CXHOar Happy St George's Day to everyone across England and further afield. We can be proud of our country  of our ingenuity  our industry. This is Labour’s plan to improve cancer treatment. Please RT so people know about our plan to rescue the NHS → http://t.co/rltPb4M5zB Labour has a proud record of promoting LGBT rights. Under my leadership  we will do so much more: http://t.co/FHG3OITFHv The NHS is in crisis  but Labour has a better plan. We’ll get 1 000 extra nurses into training this year. http://t.co/WYJVtTGlRL Labour is determined to make this a country where the voices of disabled people are heard: https://t.co/bgBNHLWRrn David Cameron hasn’t protected the NHS as Prime Minister. He won’t protect it for the future. I will. http://t.co/PpljSFEG3b David Cameron poses a risk to the very fabric and foundation of our NHS. http://t.co/mDerta3fqT We are seeing tragic scenes for the second time in days. European leaders must work together to stop more of these drownings taking place. Those dying in the Mediterranean are some of the poorest men  women and children in the world. We must act to stop these awful scenes. Our communities are changing fast but we don’t cope with change by closing our doors to each other and living our lives in separate worlds. If Iain Duncan Smith wants to try &amp; rebrand exploitative zero-hours contracts  fine. I’ll ban them if you elect a Labour govt on 7 May. Too many young people are working hard doing internships for months on end without pay. This has got to change. .@David_Cameron I believe my plan can give this country a better future than yours. Disagree? Prove it - debate me &amp; let the people decide. David Cameron has decided not to attend tonight’s debate. If you're applying for the job of PM  you should turn up to the job interview. It's a scandal that children are dying because the EU stopped search &amp; rescue in the Med. As PM I would push the EU to #RestartTheRescue 70 years ago today  British soldiers liberated Bergen-Belsen. A stark reminder of the reason we must fight the hate that exists today. I am ready to put an end to the tired old idea that as long as we look after the rich and powerful we will all be OK. On day one of a Labour government we will start to tackle tax avoidance. We believe everyone should play by the same rules. David Cameron can't tell you where a penny of the money is coming from for his NHS policy. You can't fund the NHS from an IOU. We're now seeing a Tory campaign based on deceit. I was asked about it earlier  this is what I said: https://t.co/GicVUiKah5 We’ll protect the entire education budget We’ll restore the role of Sure Start We’ll deliver smaller class sizes http://t.co/w3lkQQZB05 If you were in any doubt about who the Tories stand up for  they're now defending the indefensible nom-dom tax loophole. Britain will only succeed when working people succeed. There should be the same rules for everyone. http://t.co/AhFbnvsXW4 There are now 116 000 non-doms  costing our country a huge amount. It isn’t justifiable &amp; it makes Britain an offshore tax haven for a few. We all use the same roads We’re all protected by our police &amp; armed forces We all rely on the NHS We should all pay taxes by the same rules. We will scrap the “non-dom” loophole that allows some wealthy people to avoid paying the taxes which everyone else pay. Britain will only succeed when working people succeed – that means the same rules for everyone  including non-doms. http://t.co/MCrLtu1Zaq When a serious figure like Tony Blair warns UK national interest is threatened by a Tory 2nd term  people from all parties should take note. I want to say  Nigel Farage's comment about the NHS and HIV was disgusting. He should be ashamed. The fact he isn't says so much. The choice in this campaign is clear  between the Tories' failing plan &amp; Labour's better plan. If you want change  you need to vote for it. David Cameron chose the format but he was the invisible man in this debate. He couldn't defend his record on the NHS and extreme cuts. I am passionate about our vision for action on zero-hours  tuition fees and the NHS. David Cameron had nothing to say tonight. If you’re struggling on a zero-hours contract right now  here’s what Labour will do for you: http://t.co/Ort41qvTux A worker who has been on a zero-hours contract asked me a question at my event earlier. This is what I told him: https://t.co/AQukRX6LOg If you work regular hours for three months  Labour will give you a legal right to a regular contract  not a zero-hours contract. In case you just missed this on TV: Martin Freeman appears in our first election broadcast → https://t.co/RPEDDo7eIX If you’re a fan of Martin Freeman  I think you’ll like this video he's made on the choice on offer at this election→ https://t.co/Y17lj1mF3W #40days#40ways http://t.co/9Nqe7xXAVT http://t.co/Y1DhqRbL2D I've written in @TheSundayMirror on why I will ban exploitative zero hours contracts: http://t.co/Ah55KS2x6C http://t.co/9kKkslcTHC Thank you to everyone campaigning for a Labour government today. We’re going to win this street by street with your help. #Labourdoorstep There's a real choice in this election. Over the next six weeks  I'll be campaigning street-by-street. Get involved: http://t.co/Qpxtf3b29y Thanks to everyone who watched tonight. We saw the choice on May 7th: Cameron can't defend his record  I will fight for working families. No one will believe the PM on VAT after he said they weren’t going to raise it in 2010  and then put it up a few weeks later. #PMQs Every Tory govt for 40 years has raised VAT. It hits the poorest the hardest - but that won’t stop David Cameron http://t.co/PS0WEhexrO Raising VAT hits pensioners and poorest the hardest. That’s not the sort of government I will lead → http://t.co/5kytVsJ9fJ There’s never been a bigger gap between the rhetoric of the Chancellor’s speech and the reality of people’s lives. #Budget2015 Our pledges are founded on the belief that Britain succeeds only when working people succeed. Retweet if you agree. http://t.co/7lPVPRra2O Thanks to everyone involved in tonight's @BBCFreeSpeech. One hour  unscripted  tough questions. Really enjoyed it. http://t.co/ZXTCeSr9CM I think Nigel Farage's comments today are wrong  divisive and dangerous. The laws we have on equality represent our values as a country. David Cameron is running scared of the head-to-head TV debate. He lost last time and he’s worried he’ll lose again. #PMQs .@David_Cameron why are you running scared of TV debates? The British people want a head-to-head TV debate. Let's give it to them. David Cameron said he would do the live TV debate with me if it happens earlier than planned. I will do it anytime  anyplace  anywhere. As PM I will give families of gay men convicted under historic indecency laws the right to overturn their conviction http://t.co/eUFKIn428z Retweet this if you back our plan to cut tuition fees and help the next generation https://t.co/4ZRcD9RSnt MPs should work for the people who elect them. I will ban Labour MPs from holding paid directorships or consultancies from May. I’ve just announced a Labour government would launch an independent review of the culture &amp; practice of HMRC when it comes to tax avoidance. David Cameron took the money  gave a job to the head of HSBC  and time and again he has let the tax avoiders get away with it. #PMQs A Labour Government will give British-linked tax havens just six months to open up their books or face sanction. http://t.co/DaeBWu1JuK Mental health is the biggest unaddressed health challenge of our age. It’s time to break the silence and end the stigma #TimetoTalk Too many of the PM's friends would get caught if he tackled tax avoiders. They’re the party of Mayfair hedge funds &amp; Monaco tax avoiders Cameron will be the first PM since the 1920s to leave office with living standards lower at the end of the Parliament than at the beginning. Under David Cameron we’re a country of food banks and bankers’ bonuses  a country of tax cuts for millionaires while millions pay more. David Cameron should stand on his record and stop running scared of TV debates. We stand in solidarity with France against this evil attack by terrorists intent on attacking our democratic way of life &amp; freedom of speech Retweet this -&gt; The A&amp;E stats that show just how bad things are under the Tories: http://t.co/weoTsWnKti Britain needs a recovery that reaches your kitchen table. Let's change the direction of our country in 2015: https://t.co/dpI6YqQbEb David Cameron has given up on compassionate conservatism. He’s not cutting vital public services because he has to but because he wants to. On behalf of the Labour Party I want to thank Gordon Brown for his outstanding 32-year parliamentary career. PM thinks Bedroom Tax is great &amp; a Mansion Tax to fund our NHS is terrible. If you’ve got big money you’ve got a friend in him #PMQs Here’s why our NHS needs a mansion tax. It’s Pure and Simple. http://t.co/ol6eRj5aAW Happy birthday Nye Bevan. Thousands of @UKLabour volunteers are out today fighting to protect what you built. #NHS #6monthstowin Retweet: This is what Nigel Farage really thinks about the NHS: https://t.co/WpUx1yKvcU .@Nigel_Farage Bring it on. I look forward to a debate with you  @David_Cameron and @Nick_Clegg in the election campaign. People on zero hours contracts while some of the richest pay zero tax is a zero-zero economy we have to change. #6monthstowin Lord Freud said disabled people weren’t worth the minimum wage. If these are his views  he can't stay in govt. #PMQs He was an aid worker  helping those in need. Those who killed him have revealed only their lack of humanity and brutality. The murder of Alan Henning by ISIL is appalling and barbaric. Our human rights laws have protected the rights of victims of crime  the elderly  the disabled and gay people. We shouldn't put that at risk We will deliver on our promise of further powers to Scotland on the timetable set out during the referendum campaign. Our United Kingdom is stronger today than it was yesterday. I am delighted and proud that the people of Scotland have made this historic decision to stay. Edinburgh Castle: http://t.co/A0wo5mGC3W #LabourNo #BetterTogerther #letsstaytogether http://t.co/qmPcjYK4my Labour founded the NHS Labour cherishes the NHS. #VoteNo for a stronger NHS. http://t.co/MRTEdvgVYQ Alex Salmond is conning people. He doesn't stand up for social justice. Today the majority of his MPs didn't turn up to the #bedroomtax vote Incredible news. We've defeated the government on the cruel bedroom tax. This is a huge blow to David Cameron. A Labour govt in 8 months will:  freeze energy bills raise the min. wage introduce fairer taxes  tax bankers’ bonuses  scrap the bedroom tax Alistair Darling showed once again tonight that Alex Salmond has absolutely no answers on key questions around independence. #BetterTogether Well done Alistair. Showed that Better Together offers the best of both worlds and Alex Salmond has no answers on the key questions. I think Baroness Warsi has acted with principle &amp; integrity. People around Britain have been shocked by the suffering we have seen in Gaza. We need a public question time  where the Prime Minister regularly submits himself or herself to questioning from the public. I’m not going to win on photo-ops. But I'll be a PM with big ideas who'll stick to my beliefs. I won’t abandon decency at the door to No10. Think people should know the Tories' real record on the NHS? Retweet this. http://t.co/hvigUgg4oG A Labour Queen’s Speech would introduce a Bill to stop NHS privatisation and make it easier for patients to see their GPs Nobody should be persecuted because of the religion they practice or the person they fall in love with.

When visiting Sochi  Govt ministers must make clear to Russian counterparts that discrimination on the grounds of sexuality is unacceptable. All the PM does by telling Britain there isn't a cost of living crisis is show millions of people he doesn't understand their lives In Britain today there are 13m people living in poverty.

I watched #13Hours. The mainstream media has FAILED when Americans rely on Hollywood actors to expose Hillary's actions! #Benghazi .@HillaryClinton attacking someone for ignoring "requests that were stonewalled"? Hmmmmm... #Benghazi #DemDebate .@HillaryClinton referred to #Obamacare as "a path to universal health care." Finally...admits her goal: a TOTAL govt takeover! #DemDebate Equal pay for equal work is already the law. There's no gun show loophole. Dems should learn the laws before trying to rewrite. #DemDebate The Dem candidates give their top 3 priorities &amp; none include natl security? Seriously? That's the most IMPORTANT responsibility! #DemDebate Praise God! Christian pastor Saeed Abedini is free from his 8-year prison sentence for spreading the Gospel &amp; planting churches in Iran! .@POTUS says we're still so powerful no nation dares attack us? Someone should tell Iran so they'll release our sailors/other hostages #SOTU Latest @POTUS broken promise: that this speech was going to be "short." #SOTU Looks like @SpeakerRyan would rather chaperon a Six Flags field trip with El Chapo than listen to more of this speech. #SOTU .@POTUS marginalizes and attacks Christians. We need a president who will fight for God &amp; country  &amp; protect our #ReligiousLiberty! #SOTU Why are Obama &amp; Hillary more interested in protecting the image of Islam than protecting American women from rape by Middle East migrants? So  @POTUS can impose strict gun laws on all Americans to stop "1 shooter" but strictly vetting all immigrants to stop 1 terrorist is wrong? Cast your vote now &amp; help settle this important BBQ ribs debate:  "Retweet" for Wet Ribs  "Like" for Dry Ribs https://t.co/zFASpX3aWf .@BarackObama You say if we can save one life we should.

Why are the @TheDemocrats more upset about @BernieSanders having access to @HillaryClinton's computer system than Russia  China  &amp; Iran? After today's attack in #Mali  the Obama-approved domestic anti-terror plan: Give up your guns &amp; memorize a Koran verse. I'm delighted to see @SpeakerRyan say we need to put a pause on accepting #SyrianRefugees  good for him. This is about national security. If @SpeakerRyan will not lead &amp; reject the importation of those fleeing the Middle East he needs to step down today &amp; let someone else lead. France has closed its borders and all @POTUS wants to do is close Gitmo. .@HillaryClinton takes credit for Bin Laden but won't accept responsibility for Benghazi. #DemDebate Blaming cops and shutting down Guantanamo is NOT a plan for public safety  @BernieSanders. #DemDebate Why stop at a $15/hr minimum wage? Reach for the stars guys! How about $50  $100  $200+ an hour?! #DemDebate #ObamaCare is a great way to reduce  healthcare costs &amp; Vegas slots are a great way to invest your kid's college savings. #DemDebate You're all grown up now. You can do it. Three words. Ten syllables. Say it with me: "Radical Islamic terrorism." #DemDebate 1. Close our borders instead of Guantanamo. #DemDebate My prayers are with the people of Paris  France. America will always have your back in the war against terrorism. Always. Medicare and Social Security are NOT entitlements. They are NOT welfare. They are EARNED benefits. #GOPDebate #CNBCGOPDebate .@HillaryClinton - It's not about why Chris Stevens was IN #Benghazi  it's about why he wasn't rescued OUT! Chris Stevens died  Hillary Clinton lied  and the Obama administration tried to cover it up. Time to tell the truth! #Benghazi Makes me sick to my stomach that Congress gets an automatic pay raise while 70 million Americans go without Soc. Sec. increase next year. Poor liberals think it's racist to deplore a brutal dictatorship. #DemDebate https://t.co/ItkrFfMYiL Marijuana question appropriate.

It's time we stop burning cars  shooting cops  &amp; recognize that life is a gift from God. #DemDebate Black lives matter because ALL lives matter. Haven't we learned from history? #DemDebate .@HillaryClinton - It's not about your emails  it's about you hiding the truth @ the expense of our national security. #DemDebate .@HillaryClinton - You may not want to talk about your emails  but you're not above the law. #DemDebate .@HillaryClinton truly believes the law does not apply to her. #DemDebate I repeat... #DemDebate https://t.co/KY7xKDTcyR If only @HillaryClinton was as passionate about protecting American diplomats as she is about blasting the GOP. #Benghazi #DemDebate Wake up  @HillaryClinton. You know who else was "burning up the phone lines begging for help"... #Benghazi #DemDebate .@BernieSander's socialist math is as solid and sound as El Chapo’s prison security. #DemDebate They believe climate change is a greater threat than Islamic extremism  that a sunburn is worse than a beheading. It's nonsense! #DemDebate Obama can shamelessly try and exploit any tragedy he wants  but it's clear that gun free zones are sitting duck zones. #UCCshooting There were 50 shootings in Chicago the past two weekends  and this administration failed to utter a word. Why? #UCCshooting Gun violence is a problem in this country  but it's not the 2nd Amendment’s fault. It's fault of evil people doing evil things. #UCCshooting 300k vets died waiting for healthcare  but Congress pumps $500 million into #PlannedParenthood each year. Talk about priorities.

Out the door with a beautiful day in Austin Texas...start it off right with a run/walk/bike....see you on the road. We cannot elect wannabe tyrants to the White House. Not now  not ever. It’s up to all of us us to stop @realDonaldTrump . .@RealDonaldTrump is “cool with being called an authoritarian ” isn't upset at Hitler comparisons &amp; thinks we won’t fight back? WRONG! Why is it that @realDonaldTrump can call himself the “unity” candidate while basing his campaign on racism  sexism  xenophobia &amp; hatred? The way I see it  it’s our job to make sure @realDonaldTrump ends this campaign every bit the loser that he started it. Many of history’s worst authoritarians started out as losers – and @realDonaldTrump is a serious threat. .@RealDonaldTrump stands ready to tear apart an America that was built on values like decency  community  and concern for our neighbors. But just because @realDonaldTrump is a loser everywhere else doesn’t mean he’ll lose this election. .@RealDonaldTrump knows he’s a loser. His insecurities are on parade: petty bullying  attacks on women  cheap racism  flagrant narcissism. Listen to experts who say @realDonaldTrump might have more money today if he’d put his inheritance in an index fund &amp; left it alone. See how @realDonaldTrump kept his father’s empire afloat using strategic corporate bankruptcies to skip out on debt. Let’s be honest - @realDonaldTrump is a loser. Count all his failed businesses. See how he cheated people w/ scams like Trump U. People ask me whether I regret my big decision  but it's too late: I'm here again at the #BostonStPats breakfast. https://t.co/jwYMF543fT And no Best Picture award  but #TheBigShort made clear we will not forget that Wall St broke our economy. This ain't over. #Oscars Congratulations #SpotlightMovie! Courageous work of our own @BostonGlobe should be cheered around the world. #Oscars .@GhostPanther is best known for #TheBigShort  but fun fact: 6 yrs ago  he helped save the @CFPB w/ this video: https://t.co/6uTs1F7Xum #tbt There’s a huge snow-eating monster w/ MA plates clearing the DC snow. If this was your doing  @Marty_Walsh  thanks! https://t.co/PfhVl93AX3 This is business as usual for Wall Street and Washington insiders  and it stinks. Not sure what’s more disgusting: That Jeb is pinning his 2016 hopes on his bro’s bailout $  or that bailed-out CEOs want to buy elections. And now  Greenberg is giving $10 million of his AIG fortune to try to save Jeb Bush’s dying Presidential campaign. https://t.co/buFLQUBaYR Once his GOP friends left office  Greenberg sued the Obama Administration because – get this – the bailout wasn’t generous enough for him… Hank Greenberg left his company just before AIG took a $182 billion bailout from the Bush Administration… Let's get this straight: CEO Hank Greenberg ran AIG as it recklessly gambled on mortgage-backed securities... I'm glad that ALL the Dem candidates for president – @HillaryClinton  @BernieSanders &amp; @MartinOMalley – are fighting for Wall St reform. We need to level the playing field and end too big to fail. I'm glad @BernieSanders is out there fighting to hold big banks accountable  make our economy safer  &amp; stop the GOP from rigging the system. But the 2016 Republicans claim they'll repeal all the new financial regulations – hoping to be chosen as Wall Street's favorite candidate. 11 big banks are still so risky that if any one started to fail  they'd need a gov bailout or risk taking down the economy – again. Took our granddaughter to the Boston @museumofscience today to catch their Pixar exhibit. Amazing – and fun! https://t.co/qnHTuY6VGY We hope you can spend the holidays with people you love! https://t.co/zQS28kksVl I agree with @HillaryClinton: “President Obama &amp; congressional Democrats should do everything they can to stop these efforts.” .@HillaryClinton is right to fight GOP efforts to sneak financial reform rollbacks into the funding bill. https://t.co/SyxC6L8tA0 So here's my message to Wall Street &amp; their GOP buddies: we're ready to fight back to protect the @CFPB. #GOPDebate Wall Street knows if they soften @CFPB support  the GOP will feel better undercutting the agency in closed-door deals. #GOPDebate Thousands of dollars on a TV ad is nothing compared to the money the big banks save if their GOP buddies go after the @CFPB. #GOPDebate The @CFPB has forced the big financial companies to return more than $11B to people they cheated on credit cards  mortgages  etc. #GOPDebate Wall Street has a problem: They know the @CFPB is working  &amp; it's incredibly popular with the families it helps. #GOPDebate So... Can we talk about that ad that just ran during the #GOPDebate where I look like a Commie dictator? 1 month ago Congress let #911health Act expire. Now it's time for action. Tell your representatives: #renew911health https://t.co/h8AyUJfv37 Don't forget! Tonight I'll be talking with @colbertlateshow about how we rebuild America's middle class. #LSSC http://t.co/3pvsTR9b6K Tonight I'll be making my 1st appearance on the @colbertlateshow. Hope you'll tune in! #LSSC http://t.co/gfeKYXCJGM I’ve lived in a world with backward-looking ideologues interfering in women's health. We’re not going back. #BringItOnTed #GOPshutdown So @TedCruz wants a big fight over defunding @PPFA? I say: #BringItOnTed I simply cannot believe that in 2015  the Senate would consider shutting down the gov to defund @PPFA &amp; women’s health care. #GOPshutdown Sometimes I look around the Senate &amp; think: Did you guys fall down  hit your heads  &amp; think you woke up in the 1950s? #GOPshutdown Happy Labor Day! Unions built our great middle class &amp; are leading the fight to rebuild our great middle class. http://t.co/n3CEOZ36Ah Shame on the GOP for playing games with women's health. Enough is enough. http://t.co/dZIx1fthEb #StandwithPP http://t.co/EGkTaSRFZ3 I'm pleased that Sen @BernieSanders and Gov @MartinOMalley are supporting @TammyBaldwin's bill to slow down the Wall Street revolving door. $15 min wage in LA  $15 for NY fast food workers  &amp; $15 for MA home health workers. That’s real change for working families. #fightfor15 The 2016 candidates should say: We don't run this country for Wall Street - we run it for people. Watch: https://t.co/oMQzvcMspV #nn15 Happy 35th anniversary to my sweetie  Bruce! I love you. http://t.co/I31dGgADTO Woo-hoo! USA! USA!

Watch my interview with @Maddow: http://t.co/QJauuHelKe Tonight I'll be talking with Rachel @Maddow about the top secret TPP trade agreement. Tune in! The Obama Admin says I'm wrong - we shouldn't worry about TPP. So why can’t the American people read the deal? http://t.co/PoavXNJlRS Looking forward to talking with @billmaher on Real Time tonight. If you have HBO  I hope you'll be watching! Tonight I'll be back on @TheDailyShow for what could be my last time before Jon retires. I hope you'll tune in! Whether you celebrate Easter  Passover  or a long-awaited spring  hope you have a good weekend with people you love. http://t.co/D7jEbtiTxx Let’s send the biggest Wall Street banks our own message: Your swagger &amp; threats won’t stop us. http://t.co/6DHfn459Nn And I’m not going to pretend our financial reform work is done when the “too big to fail banks” are bigger than they were in 2008. I’m not going to stop talking about JPMorgan’s settlement agreements that are so weak  they celebrate by giving execs a raise. I’m not going to stop talking about Citigroup’s unprecedented grasp on our government’s economic policymaking apparatus. The biggest Wall Street banks want a Washington that works only for them. Well they can forget it. http://t.co/ORtVvU5Ky0 Wall St's 2014 BONUSES were 2x the income of all full-time min wage workers. That's obscene. http://t.co/pp1C6H1DdF http://t.co/zaAS9BUPK0 If Scott Walker sees 100 000 teachers &amp; firefighters as his enemies  maybe it's time we take a closer look at his friends. Spock is gone - and so is our last chance for a Vulcan mind meld with a great son of Boston. Sad day. #LLAP Washington is rigged for the big guys - and no person has more consistently called them out for it than Jon Stewart. Good luck  Jon! Proud to earn a 100% on the new @LCVoters scorecard. I'm fighting to protect our planet for our kids &amp; grandkids. http://t.co/P4L3Su2tKq Woo-Hoo! Congratulations Patriots Nation!!! The GOP isn't even trying to pretend that they aren't bought &amp; paid for by the Koch brothers anymore. http://t.co/0IokXgAvUa I've announced a new bill to make big drug companies that break the law put more money into funding medical research: http://t.co/pG0jwB16j5 Good to see Mitt Romney suddenly talking about working families. Are corporations still people too  Mitt? Farewell Colbert Report &amp; thank you @StephenAtHome! I'll always cherish our special moments of truthiness. http://t.co/MIHQg0frDc Wall St CEOs think Antonio Weiss would do a great job overseeing Wall St reform. Doesn't that make you feel better? http://t.co/AMnywIhMoc Thanks for watching @Maddow tonight! Help us stand up to Wall St &amp; stop the risky giveaway -- go to http://t.co/BNl2I1DJX1 to fight back. Fast food workers deserve a livable wage to keep families out of poverty. When they fight  I'm proud to fight alongside them #StrikeFastFood I oppose Keystone XL  an ill-conceived project locking us into further dependence on some of the dirtiest fossil fuels on the planet. Read this eye-opening @nytimes editorial on how the big guys drowned democracy with their dollars last Tuesday: http://t.co/h7e8cTGDit Two years ago today  you helped us make history. You've always had my back  &amp; I've worked hard to have yours. #tbt http://t.co/j1M76OiloN Happy Election Day! This is what our democracy is all about. I voted this morning - did you? http://t.co/3P2btxQp8I We lost a great fighter today. Mayor Menino is gone  but his spirit lives on in every neighborhood in Boston. http://t.co/9EQ4VwK9zU If we're going to keep the Senate majority  we need Democratic women to vote  &amp; we need Democratic women candidates to win. #rallywomen We believe women shouldn’t have to ask their boss permission to get birth control  and we’re fighting to reverse Hobby Lobby. #rallywomen I can't believe I have to say this in 2014: We believe in equal pay for equal work  and Democrats are fighting for it. #rallywomen We believe you should be able to get an education without getting crushed by debt  and Democrats are fighting for it. #rallywomen We can whimper  we can whine  or we can fight back by voting on Nov 4th. Me? I’m fighting back. #rallywomen 2/3 of minimum wage workers are women  but the minimum wage no longer keeps a mom &amp; her baby out of poverty. #rallywomen Bloomberg found women earn less in 99.6% of jobs  but women can still be fired for asking what the guy down the hall makes. #rallywomen So many working people are ready to fight @ScottWalker that I had to stand on a table at UWM to talk today! http://t.co/bWkfl2FvaD Attn regulators: You work for the American people  not for the big banks. Check out my interview with @NPR: http://t.co/EeVmHSJ5LM Imagine what Washington would look like with a GOP-controlled House &amp; Senate paid for by Wall Street: http://t.co/SYOiobQT1F If we're going to stop the GOP's anti-women agenda  we have to stand up &amp; fight. http://t.co/QErzMgEIIy Mitch McConnell just doesn't get it  but @AlisonForKY does: Students need degrees  not debt. http://t.co/U3OPHQU0X8 #bankonstudents Deeply disappointed that my GOP colleagues refused to give our #bankonstudents bill an up-or-down vote today. Our kids can't wait for this. Tell @Team_Mitch &amp; the Senate GOP: Drop the filibuster &amp; give #bankonstudents a vote. #higherednotdebt http://t.co/o2hj4ItVWP Every single Republican in the US Senate voted against equal pay for equal work for women today. Unreal. #equalpay Banks should not be able to make secret deals with schools to market debit cards to students. We need transparency. http://t.co/a8nucW6x7i Glad AG Holder is in #Ferguson for independent federal investigation of Michael Brown's death. We need straight answers about what happened. This is America  not a war zone. The people of #Ferguson just want answers. We all want answers. Corporate inversion is a bland name for loopholes that allow corporate freeloading. Read this: http://t.co/BJURDvsR00 http://t.co/9DTXh7JUh0 The interests of big corps shouldn't come before women's rights. Learn about our new bill to fight #HobbyLobby: http://t.co/QYrahiERrL Unbelievable: 5.7M Americans won't have health insurance because the GOP won't expand Medicaid http://t.co/qbK7evZmPy #peopleoverpolitics The current Supreme Court has headed in a very scary direction. #scotus #hobbylobby Can't believe we live in a world where we'd even consider letting big corps deny women access to basic care based on vague moral objections. Happy to be in KY this weekend to help @AlisonForKY! Support her campaign now: http://t.co/FOihh4JF5l #kysen http://t.co/7MFQuSv40Q Proud of MA for raising the minimum wage to $11/hr  the highest in the country. Now it's time for Congress to take action! #RaiseTheWage Spoke to @BarackObama tonight at the @WhiteHouse about #bankonstudents. We're not done fighting to give kids relief from student loan debt. Watch @BarackObama join in support of our #BankonStudents Act to refinance student loans. Thanks  Mr. President! http://t.co/W2DDp6T6Dw I'll work with Republicans  Democrats  Libertarians  Vegetarians - anyone willing to fight for working people. http://t.co/gUrYdBcnBO Tune in: Tonight I'll be talking with @StephenAtHome on The Colbert Report. (Great news or the greatest news?) http://t.co/xKzZcLXjWF Bank size  not performance  determines Wall Street CEO pay. And the big banks are 38% BIGGER than they were in 2008. http://t.co/8CV5oLM55N You should be able to support a family if you work a full time job. The GOP is just wrong to block the minimum wage increase. #raisethewage Our regulators already have all the tools they need to protect a free and open Internet. They should stand up and use them. Reports that the FCC may gut net neutrality are disturbing &amp; would be one more way the playing field is tilted for the rich &amp; powerful. We don’t know who is going to have the next big idea in this country  but we’re pretty sure they’re going to need to get online to do it. I'm concerned about megabank Citigroup's concentration of power in key government jobs. Read more: http://t.co/PpHnZayrH5 $2 trillion in student loan debt? That is obscene. http://t.co/DkqHJLjEws Tonight I'll be on @TheDailyShow to talk with Jon about how the system is rigged against working people. Tune in! Making sure women get equal pay for equal work should be a no-brainer. I'm simply appalled by my Republican colleagues right now. #equalpay I can't believe we're still talking about #equalpay in 2014. http://t.co/ZKYXl6fWC9 With today's McCutcheon #SCOTUS ruling  the game just became even more rigged for the rich and powerful. Shame on @DarrellIssa for refusing to let @RepCummings speak today. When did censorship become the policy of the US Congress? Thanks @BarackObama for dropping "chained CPI" Social Security cuts from the budget.

When even IDS thinks it's a cruel cut too far  it is definitely time for a fundamental rethink  https://t.co/rJIB4beuuO A joy to meet Mohammed  who came to Scotland for treatment for his injuries from explosion that killed his parents. https://t.co/ZSwR9KwIFW The fact that this articulate  passionate  principled young woman is a member of the party I lead makes me proud https://t.co/32C5CfzQ8p As @AlexSalmond makes his last speech in @ScotParl ('for now'  he says!)  we should all thank him for his outstanding contribution. And congrats to @EnglandRugby on winning #RBS6Nations - we were happy to be of assistance 😉 Brilliant @Scotlandteam - well done on a great win! #AsOne #RBS6Nations #Dunblane - in our thoughts and in our hearts  today and always. Thanks to all my @theSNP colleagues who  in midst of #snp16  also organised event to formally adopt me as candidate for Glasgow Southside Not that I'm jealous  but my wee niece was much more excited to see @MhairiBlack tonight than me #snp16 https://t.co/XAzARLl9e0 Good morning to all @theSNP members and friends heading to Glasgow for #snp16. #BothVotesSNP Happy International Women's Day to women and girls all over the world. #PledgeForParity #IWD2016 Thrilled and honoured to become the first official patron of the Scotland Women's National Team. #SWNT @ScottishFA https://t.co/uoO2Z4gs2k Well done @Scotlandteam - great win. #AsOne #6Nations SNP MPs don't sit where Liberals did. The Liberals sat on government benches with the Tories - we haven't forgotten! https://t.co/EXSDWVh6Q1 I will be with @LeanneWood @CarolineLucas and many others in London on Saturday to say no to Trident renewal https://t.co/YOGo9zihu4 Worth a watch - great film from the fab @theSNP social media team about how @scotgov won a fair deal for Scotland.  https://t.co/mEuxDeFY0Z Busy day yesterday  concluding #fiscalframework. Credit to @JohnSwinney for so resolutely protecting Scotland's interests in negotiations. 6/6...so  in principle  I'll argue for an In vote...&amp; continue to make case for independence on its many merits. You're welcome @KennyFarq 😉 4/6...if UK votes to leave EU (&amp; Scotland votes to stay) I think it inevitable (whatever I say) that demand for #indyref2 will grow... 3/6...principle 1. I believe Scotland should be independent. Principle 2. I believe UK should stay in EU... 2/6...starting with reminder that not everything is a cynical calculation. Sometimes (yes  even for pols)  positions flow from principle... 1/6 I feel a civic duty to help @KennyFarq uncontort (is that a word?) his logic... Great pic. Hopefully  a wee girl will one day look at a woman president and also think 'that can be me' #rolemodels  https://t.co/4LR3LtF3Fb 'Declare' independence. Just out of interest @telegraphnews - when and where did I say that? https://t.co/h1VSDofHJF The feeling's mutual  Captain 😊 https://t.co/bd0CYhAg8K OK  it seems there are folk out there - and not just Tories - who say tin of juice  instead of can. (#weird) What's with the 'tin'? Everyone knows it's a can of juice. #typicaltories 😉 https://t.co/IRZA1C9rzi 2/2...that's why @theSNP will lead a positive Scottish campaign for continued EU membership. #voteIn #euref 1/2 The EU isn't perfect - &amp; I'd prefer Scotland to be an independent member state - but I believe it's in our best interests to stay in... Welcome to Glasgow City Councillor Russell Robertson  who has today left Labour to join @thesnp https://t.co/PcLWvDMjcn Congratulations to our new Councillor for Oban North @joolsmc. Great result &amp; the 27th @thesnp win out of the 30 by-elections since May Is this a Scottish Labour charm offensive? Calling voters 'fools' is certainly a novel approach to campaigning #sp16 https://t.co/tTzmOLqlop Greig Laidlaw is such a credit to @Scotlandteam - great player &amp; great ambassador. Disappointing result but lots of positives too. #AsOne Proud day for @UofGlasgow https://t.co/2bVzqnvYF2 This '£4.5bn' is difference between UKG opening position of a £7bn CUT and current position of an almost £3bn CUT!!  https://t.co/Qcg3n3vcun What we are being asked to 'move towards' is a £3bn cut. We'll continue to work for fair deal that delivers the Vow. https://t.co/HH1VGa7Pm6 Brilliant @STVNews poll today - on all fronts - but let's keep working hard @theSNP  https://t.co/1EcPKUxv7r Delighted to launch @VisitScotland new global campaign this morning.

On #WorldCancerDay lets unite and resolve  one day  to beat it once and for all. Very clear that everyone earning between £11 000 &amp; 20 000 would pay Labour's tax rise. Not clear that any of them would get £100 back 1/2... If I signed up to what Treasury is proposing - that would be failing Scotland. Big time.  https://t.co/QQ1VcCvQCv Labour's basic rate tax rise would hit low paid - and fact they've felt need to come up with a half baked 'rebate' scheme shows they know it Hard lines @andy_murray. You will always be our champion! Now hurry home &amp; enjoy becoming a dad! #AusOpen Sad news. A broadcasting institution. Not sure we make them like #TerryWogan anymore. RIP  https://t.co/fyVBMDWnPm Well done to @jamieszymko &amp; everyone else involved in the first ever @theSNP conference organised for disabled people  by disabled people Barely 2pm and Scotland already has two #AusOpen champions.

Fantastic achievement #AusOpen https://t.co/EvRAN6riaK Well done @andy_murray! What a weekend ahead - 3 Scots playing in 4 #AusOpen finals. Good luck to Andy  @jamie_murray &amp; @GordonReid91 I don't back a 'negative' pro EU campaign. If In campaign copies negativity of #projectfear in #indyref  it'll lose https://t.co/ZhxBaSs1HR I'm standing up for a fair deal for Scotland - Labour should try it sometime  instead of always backing the Tories.  https://t.co/HwypYTYYMP Very helpful factsheet about A&amp;E.

So I'll be out today campaigning for #BothVotesSNP  https://t.co/kZEbLTnNhu This is exactly what I was talking about on @MarrShow. #projectfear2 is not way to win. Let's hear positive case  https://t.co/43gXlRB6s6 Many congratulations to @StephySNP - new Councillor in Hamilton. 26th (out of 29 contested) by-election win for @theSNP since May. Glad to hear UK gov defeated on Trade Union bill in the Lords today. Time for a fundamental rethink. #dropthebill Hearing rumours that UKG might go for early vote on Trident renewal. Labour needs to quickly decide what side it's on - hopefully against. 1st 2016 poll. Good news for @theSNP on party ratings &amp; views of @scotgov performance on key issues. #BothVotesSNP https://t.co/FteaQoZG49 Bad timing for Tories to launch broadcast about protecting pay packets on the day Tory/Ind Moray Council talks about 18% hike in council tax Later today  I will announce a £54m boost for mental health services https://t.co/p6EkQQyftC I think this is my favourite - always made me cry when I was wee.

We think those tests can be passed  https://t.co/oC90vuX4Zf Thanks to all who have worked so hard to get @forthroadbridge open tomorrow from 6am to all vehicles bar HGVs. Work to open to HGVs ongoing. Today's poll is a nice boost - but polls are just polls.

SNP will vote against air strikes on Syria https://t.co/gVQJsbXN21 So a party that says it is anti-airstrikes has just made a vote for airstrikes more likely?! Go figure. #Syria Happy St Andrew's Day. https://t.co/EtjF3WvOuc Think we should rename tomorrow St Andy's Day Congratulations to Leon Smith &amp; #teamGB on an incredible @DavisCup victory - &amp; especially to the amazing Murray bros. What an achievement Well done Andy &amp; Jamie #TeamMurray #TeamGB @DavisCup Though these by elections described as @theSNP holds  Lab won them on first preferences in 2012 - SNP won both on first preferences tonight Well done to all who kept pressure on Chancellor to drop tax credit cuts. Now need to scrutinise housing benefit cuts #AutumnStatement So Labour managed to vote for  against and abstain on #Trident renewal today.

They voted with the Tories to protect the Tories' right to cut https://t.co/2m5px3pBbg Labour just voted with Tories to block devo of tax credits - so we don't get to set policy  just apply sticking plaster to Tory cuts #shame It will be my privilege to lay a wreath at the Stone of Remembrance in Edinburgh this morning #lestweforget https://t.co/rD3XKBgVgC Happy 18th birthday to my nephew @ethan0wens - seems no time since he was my baby boy.

Australians can hardly be reassured by a Prime Minister who openly admits on national television he does not trust his own Treasurer. The only thing Mr Turnbull has delivered are big tax cuts for multinationals and big tax cuts for people earning more than $180 000.

Our outdated immigration laws no longer meet our economic needs  our national security imperatives  or our values as a people. We can’t just sit by and wait for another tragedy to happen again.

As President  I will establish a national dashboard on overdose and addiction to monitor the problem  and track our response nationwide.

My position is clear: today's fast-track vote was a vote against American jobs. The House must act and say no to #TPP. I kept a sign on my desk that said “No Irish Need Apply"  as a reminder we were all once strangers in a strange land https://t.co/YuteEVMeqB Join me on May 30th at 10am on Federal Hill in Baltimore  MD for a special announcement. http://t.co/fX2b4u0hok http://t.co/kUYSB8Bh3D I am opposed to the death penalty on principle.

All of us share a profound feeling of grief for Freddie Gray &amp; his family(1/2) Well played  Mr. President. Well played. If we were able to bail out big banks  we can figure out a way to refinance college loans. #debtfreecollege http://t.co/ncZSpAPjgx Opposing bad trade deals like TPP is just common sense. Let's make our voices heard. https://t.co/DcfNwa3Mx3 #TPP is a race to the bottom  a chasing of lower wages abroad  which does nothing to help our economy here at home. http://t.co/9dZzSwBEp1 Rather than reducing or privatizing Social Security benefits  we must expand them. #EconForAll http://t.co/GvDUHS941g We must end bad trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership that hurt wages and ship jobs overseas. #EconForAll http://t.co/ClhJAiDobt How can you get pulled over in this country for a broken taillight  but if you wreck the world’s economy you are untouchable? #EconForAll In the 1980s  CEOs earned 46x their average worker. Today  the average CEO earns 331x as much. #EconForAll Equal pay for equal work is not only good for women  but good for our economy. http://t.co/HiObgSDTBS #EqualPayDay The death penalty is ineffective  expensive  &amp; at odds w/our values as Americans. 152 more reasons to do away w/it: http://t.co/TqqgZNiuM6 For the record  I've always loved The Simpsons. This video is appalling but it shows why accountability &amp; transparency are so important. It shouldn't take a video to ensure justice. My thoughts &amp; prayers are w/Walter Scott's family. Far too many families across the nation have endured tragic losses like this one. http://t.co/JZGV8Vj4Iq Go @TerrapinHoops!

Shout-out to Jack Maple &amp; @CommissBratton for revolutionizing data-driven policing &amp; inspiring Baltimore's CitiStat. #Brookings Most powerful moment of the Oscars: @PattyArquette calling for equal pay for equal work for women. This *must* be a national priority. In MD we are raising the minimum wage to $10.10/hour. Let's #RaisetheWage together as a nation to increase economic mobility. #SOTU It's about time  #SCOTUS. #MarriageEquality is not a states' rights issue  it is a fundamental right that we should extend to every American .@BarackObama is right on #KeystoneXL. Creates too much CO2 &amp; not nearly enough jobs. We need a jobs agenda that meets our climate challenge I intend to commute Maryland’s four remaining death sentences to life without the possibility of parole. http://t.co/ayKUKh9JUH Welcome home to Maryland  Alan Gross. Here's wishing you boundless joy with your friends and family this holiday season. Millions can now work &amp; raise their families without living in fear. Tonight we celebrate  tomorrow we get back to work. #ImmigrationAction I agree with President Obama's Net Neutrality approach. We shouldn't have gatekeepers picking winners &amp; losers online.

We love having @VeepHBO in Maryland. http://t.co/XKP2qVa158 Today's event is part of the #StarSpangled200 celebration. Check out other upcoming events: http://t.co/88BrwJNuZq I was asked earlier today and answered that I do believe it is probably time for the Washington Redskins to change their team name. The greatest power we have is power of our principles. We're not a country that should send children away &amp; send them back to certain death No woman should have her health care decisions made by her boss. Period. This decision is wrong and a setback for women’s health. Prosperity doesn’t trickle down from the top. Never has. When workers earn more money businesses have more customers &amp; economy grows #IADems Our founders didn’t belittle science and learning; they aspired to it. They didn’t appeal to America’s fears; they inspired courage #IADems The patriots who made America great did not pray for their president to fail  they prayed for their president to succeed. #IADems I applaud the President's plan to reduce CO2 pollution from existing power plants http://t.co/IKuB4vh8Ab I love that as governor of MD I can still play street music in Annapolis. http://t.co/kQ6umd9VBS .@TheTodayShow was live at MD's most popular beach travel spot  @OCMaryland  this morning. Watch the clip: http://t.co/mfn7JVh23o Lots of people are headed to @OCMaryland this weekend. Are you one of them? What other MD beaches are you visiting this weekend? Great to be at @PressClubDC today talking about the 200th anniv. of our nat'l anthem this yr. Join the celebration! http://t.co/88BrwK5Edy We fought to #RaiseTheWage b/c nobody who works full time should have to raise their family in poverty. #1010means a raise for MD families. I just signed legislation that will raise Maryland’s minimum wage to $10.10/hr. Pleased to announce that we've reached an agreement and @HouseOfCards will film its third season in Maryland. The marijuana decriminalization bill will make it easier for law enforcement to focus on higher priority crimes &amp; drive down violence in MD Teaching my son how to drive… http://t.co/dL3oWP4pH3 I hope that decriminalization leads to a greater focus on more serious threats to public safety &amp; the lives of our citizens.  Decriminalizing possession of marijuana is an acknowledgement of the low priority our courts  prosecutors  &amp; police attach to this issue. I intend to sign the bill sent to my desk that will decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana.  Our General Assembly voted to #RaiseTheWage in Maryland - it's time Congress does the same for the rest of the country. With the State House's vote  both chambers have voted to raise Maryland's minimum wage to $10.10/hr. I will enthusiastically sign this bill Good luck to Maryland women’s hoops team in their Final Four game against Notre Dame.

Discussed the legislative session  budget  &amp; more http://t.co/e3DddyyobW Wishing you and your family a very happy Easter. Shocked and saddened by events in Brussels - the thoughts of Londoners are with the victims this morning. Folks - just 50 days left to make sure @ZacGoldsmith is elected to City Hall - not Corbyn and Khan. #BackZac2016 https://t.co/nNun2z3PUh Americans would never accept EU restrictions - so why should we? https://t.co/HThdQk7AqM Lee Rigby's murder sickened Londoners. How could Khan have hired someone who suggested it was in any way fabricated? https://t.co/WwaqfaPDlE The ratchet is clicking forwards. When you come to vote  the status quo is not on offer. https://t.co/WDcyK0nMIB A chance to energise our democracy  cut bureaucracy  save £8bn a year  control our borders &amp; strike new trade deals https://t.co/4a9efjFpBG Brilliant piece by my friend @nadhimzahawi https://t.co/2JuZxQGvGD This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to vote for real change in Britain’s relations with Europe. https://t.co/r9yw42tW4U Great to welcome my good friend (and I hope my successor as Mayor of London) @ZacGoldsmith to Uxbridge yesterday. https://t.co/ik1efvRnwb This is the moment to finally decide and these are the questions I pose  humbly and respectfully. https://t.co/wttmiNfYtD TfL have confirmed @SadiqKhan has a £2bn black hole in his plans - meaning any promise he makes on transport is meaningless. #ESHustings We should all denounce this week’s Tube strike – but Sadiq Khan won’t. Come on  Khan: man up. https://t.co/WK2bmxsNxE Ken Livingstone bowed to the unions  Sadiq Khan would do the same: https://t.co/FrBYB9ZZXs Incredibly Sadiq Khan won't condemn this pointless strike. Massive support amongst Londoners for the night tube. He is stuck in the past. We won’t win if we don’t fight back.  https://t.co/Lfcf9OmxCP Saddened to hear the terrible news from Paris - my thoughts and those of Londoners are with Parisians tonight Right folks  here's why you should #BackZac2016 https://t.co/uKPMEOTRft via @YouTube Just congratulated @ZacGoldsmith in person.  He's hard working  dedicated and passionate about London and its people. http://t.co/AMkZOhsJzI So pleased for @ZacGoldsmith - he's principled  a fighter and the right man to protect London and Londoners.  He will be a great Mayor. My thoughts today on behalf of all Londoners. #sevenseven http://t.co/P943eWAnW5 Very sad to hear about Charles Kennedy. I knew him for 20 years as a man who was good fun &amp; kind - thinking of his family most of all today. Well done @metpoliceuk for protecting @DouglasCarswell. Outrageous to target an MP. We live in a democracy. A HUGE thank you to everyone who voted Conservative  especially the people of Uxbridge and South Ruislip. More here: https://t.co/ipRk9UdDZ4 Morning folks - the day is upon us. If you don't want Mili stumbling into Downing Street in 24 hours  use your vote and #VoteConservative. Right folks – it’s nearly time. Do it for Britain. #VoteConservative tomorrow. http://t.co/tAJu5zTFHD Final hours  and a great response for @HannahDavid_HW in South Harrow. http://t.co/Paq8qgf7F1 Further proof it was a waste of good stone: http://t.co/oHPokNJ28x #EdStone As ever  another great edition of the Standard. http://t.co/G5cATL8kry Don't let Ed Miliband sink this country with his commie slab of rock: https://t.co/Nlq9Ehs9v9 #EdStone Who does he think he is? Moses? Future archaeologists will gaze with bafflement at this waste of good stone. http://t.co/DKwDs5Kz4b Enjoy the bank holiday weekend  folks - but don't forget we only have a few days left before you cast your vote: https://t.co/L3EKI6lGDK Ed - you don't get private sector jobs when you endlessly bash the private sector. #JustNotUpToIt #BBCQT Send for the lectern! #BBCQT #JustNotUpToIt http://t.co/c2EZIRPYSj Mili floundering and in denial - he can't become PM without the support of the SNP. #JustNotUpToIt #BBCQT Thelma and Louise rightly getting nobbled for their economic record. #BBCQT http://t.co/DfllCJSKwC Nightmare performance from Mili. Showing once and for all that he's #JustNotUpToIt. #BBCQT Mili talks about props - where's your lectern now Ed? #JustNotUpToIt #BBCQT PM did brilliantly - strong  clear and passionate. #BBCQT Only Dave can get the change we need in Europe - imagine Mili on the global stage... Dave spot on in reminding people what Labour left us with. #bbcqt http://t.co/cZYtPqOlBQ Coming to a garden near you: Mili - a man propped up by a lectern and waiting to be propped up by the SNP. http://t.co/XVuQX4Hpc8 Under Miliband every field will be supplied with a lectern in case Mili wants to address the grass. http://t.co/18dAZCVJL4 Great to join the PM earlier to highlight our sound  common sense policies supporting working families. http://t.co/FkNlOJ2MbF If Ed Miliband's driving the car  Nicola Sturgeon will be next to him  yanking the steering wheel to the left. https://t.co/J2iTuHhzaC There is a Battle for Britain next month - and one this country cannot afford to lose: https://t.co/j4OmbBE900 #GE2015 A frightening glimpse of a possible future - with the SNP making mincemeat of Miliband. #BBCDebate #ChallengersDebate #CoalitionofChaos Brilliant @Conservatives policy on the Right to Buy  and a good way of ensuring it is funded. We are on the side of workers  and will change the law so that no one earning the minimum wage will pay income tax. http://t.co/TL3loo0gLF Hugely optimistic and positive speech from Dave  setting out the @Conservatives' plan for the next 5 years. Poor Mili. Even his old comrade Lord Digby Jones has slammed Labour's economics saying they don't add up. #milishambles No commitment of 4 nuclear subs eh? Already started your coalition negotiations with the SNP  Ed? Mili won't say that they borrowed too much last time. Why hand the keys of the car back to the Thelma and Louise of British politics? Same old Balls  #SameOldLabour. They promised strict rules on borrowing in 1997 and look where that got us. http://t.co/snOtAtEET9 The @Conservatives are helping huge numbers of people to pass on a little bit more to their children - supporting a natural human instinct. Why won't Labour sign up to plugging the #NHS spending gap? Because they want to keep health "weaponised". Shabby. A red line? Britain’s defences are not something to be bartered away. http://t.co/uJTNcGhur4 We cannot allow Labour to #BallsUp our national security. Defence of the realm is far too important. http://t.co/7ebGWbjBQT Tories represent the whole of Britain and are the only party taking the country forward. http://t.co/lRvgMDex4C Literally an amazing #BallsUp. http://t.co/bgFP2z1TKx Sturgeon would eat Mili for breakfast and break our great union of nations. http://t.co/5g4sFJEQuL Blair to rescue Mili? Non tali auxilio nec defensoribus istis. Blair is wrong. Britain can lead reform in the EU - and only the Tories have a plan. From today over 26 million people will keep more of their hard-earned money. Go to http://t.co/MCKjn9IrzL to see how much you save. #taxcuts Conservatives cut taxes. Labour will raise them. http://t.co/jwQhugbWLa Happy Easter everyone! Labour failed to build enough during the boom. We have built record numbers and will do more. #housing The chaos that might enfold us vs the competence and clarity of the PM at last night's #leadersdebate: https://t.co/hrnZKvZ81Q I agree with Dave. #leadersdebate http://t.co/UPyCEHi2z3 David Cameron the only one who sounded like a leader with a plan for Britain. #cameronincharge #leadersdebate Miliband patently insincere and faintly alarming - Cameron in control; whiff of sulphur about Nige. #cameronincharge DC won. Miles ahead. In control. Strong leader. #leadersdebate Dave owns Mili on Labour hypocrisy - Doncaster Labour council use zero hours contracts for heaven's sake​. #JustNotUpToIt #leadersdebate Miliband has bored on about zero hours contracts all night - he would destroy jobs. #JustNotUpToIt #leadersdebate Tories have built record numbers of affordable homes in London. #leadersdebate Cameron is completely in control - imagine the others negotiating with the leaders of Europe. #leadersdebate Well done Clegger for asking for an apology from Mili - not that we'll get one. #saysorryed #leadersdebate Miliband lecturing people on debt? Really? #JustNotUpToIt #leadersdebate More #militripe about homes - Tories have built more council homes in 5 years than Labour in 13. #leadersdebate From Labour  with love. #nomoneyleft #leadersdebate http://t.co/nig3xwW2mG Greens want an EU Referendum!! Natalie much more dynamic than Mr #JustNotUpToIt Ed. Farage says there is nothing we can do - well we certainly can't if Labour get in​. #voteukipgetmiliband #leadersdebate Backdoor Nige would let Miliband migrate into Downing Street. #voteukipgetmiliband #leadersdebate How many immigrants would Farage turn away? Not at all clear what he is really saying. #leadersdebate Ridiculous now for Labour to sound tough on immigration when they deliberately opened the floodgates​. #leadersdebate Dave easily the best and most balanced in the first half  especially on NHS debate. #leadersdebate Mili can't answer on Mid Staffs cover up. #JustNotUpToIt Ed caught out on NHS privatisation #justnotuptoit #leadersdebate PM: "Money spent on doctors not bureaucrats​" - totally right. #leadersdebate Great point about 7 day NHS service from Cameron - and only with a strong economy to fund it . #leadersdebate Come on then Miliband tell us what you would cut you cowardy custard. #leadersdebate Becoming ever clearer that SNP would tilt Labour even further left - behold the chaos that might enfold us. #leadersdebate Again Mili says he would make cuts - on what and on whom? Cameron zapped him on Labour tax increases. #leadersdebate How is Mili going to cut the deficit? He can't say...blank nonsense. #militripe #leadersdebate Good to see yet more business leaders backing our policies which support investment and job creation: http://t.co/Ah9rqQ3RAC #businessletter Cracking morning in Hendon with a great swathe of supporters out to launch the Tory campaign.

Key learning: Cabinet decision making might be a lot simpler with a rose ceremony process. #TheBachelorAU Hang on  who's this second guy?! Not even a rate cut from the RBA could deal with the inflation levels in that hair style. #TheBachelorAU My running times are slowing down but they are lightening compared to this process! Just decide mate. #TheBachelorAU Cheeky text from Gladys telling me she loves the show but not to tell anyone. She's not on Twitter so this doesn't count. #TheBachelorAU It must be terrible for those girls. Imagine having every word u say captured  televised  and taken out of context. Oh wait.. #TheBachelorAU Hang on. There's a bachelorette?! Why don't they just hook her up with this guy and save us all some time. #TheBachelorAU What's with this music? A bit of cold chisel wouldn't go astray.  #TheBachelorAU It occurs to me that  lately  Gladys has been declining meeting invitations on wed and thurs nights. Coincidence? #TheBachelorAU I thought he'd made his decision when he just kissed one of the girls! My daughters are laughing at me. #TheBachelorAU That goatee. #TheBachelorAU He seems very sincere for a guy who is two-timing  live on TV. This is only a 30 minute show  right? #TheBachelorAU Stuck at home on the couch with man-flu. Daughters have hijacked the TV and are watching The Bachelor. Going to be a loooong night.

My deepest thanks to those who have been out braving this weather  working hard to help all of us who are affected by this storm. As a large number of schools will be closed today  parents should check http://t.co/sWP49r7Qph or call their local school for more info. To ease strain on transport/road networks please again try to travel to work outside standard peak times – I urge employers to be flexible. The weather is forecast to worsen tonight so the SES is encouraging people to head home early while it's still daylight. Stay safe everyone. Rest in peace  Ritchie. A great player  captain  commentator and gentleman. I've asked for flags to be lowered to half-mast today.

People wishing to lay a floral tribute to the victims are invited to do so at Martin Place. Flags will fly at half-mast today on NSW Government buildings to honour those who tragically lost their lives in the siege at Lindt cafe. Today we must come together like never before. We are stronger together. We will get through this together. The values we held dear yesterday we hold dear today.. values of freedom  democracy and harmony. They define us yesterday  today  tomorrow. Unless you work in an exclusion zone  please go about tomorrow as you normally would. Exclusion zones can be found at http://t.co/cpPgIfCzXC I'm proud of how we've responded so far  but my principal concern remains for the people who remain trapped by this event. Pray for them. I have complete confidence in the @nswpolice who have been handling the situation at Martin Place w the professionalism we expect of them At 8:15pm I'll be joining NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione to provide an update on the situation at Martin Place Have just spoken with leaders of Sydney's valued Islamic community. Appreciated their support and reassured them we're in this together. We are being tested today in Sydney. But whatever the test  we will face it head-on. And we will remain a strong  democratic  civil society. I'll shortly be joining NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione to brief the public on the unfolding incident at Martin Place. 2/2 I’ve spoken to Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione &amp; have full confidence NSW Police are working effectively to resolve the situation. 1/2 My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the situation in Martin Place &amp; NSW Police who are trained to deal with these events.

Donate @ http://t.co/fM1RgBLN Heading back up north to meet fine furniture makers to see how the bad Labor-Green back room deal will affect them. We need to innovate and grow opportunities in forestry  not shut the industry down. That's why we are backing opportunities in biofuel. Part of Libs plan for forest industry is backing biofuel as an alternative use of plantation &amp; native timber residue instead of woodchips. Despite govt's claim of industry support  the TCCI  TFGA  &amp; Minerals Co don't support the forest deal. And neither do several enviro groups! And once again Ministers Nick McKim and Cassy O'Connor ran away from Cabinet so they can 'reserve the right' to attack the forest deal later At IOOF / TCCI Tasmanian Business Leader Awards. A fantastic celebration of personal &amp; corporate excellence. Great @abcgrandstand interview @virginia03 Making me clucky!
