We're on our way to a powerful transition. Don't think the bubble will pop  just get bigger! @SallyOsberg When talking about arc of change  not easy to declare victory. Still have long way to go on civil rights  but have milestones. @SallyOsberg Idea of @PeaceCorps can be most powerful if it's not an experience that says "there's just one way to do it". @RogerLMartin @tceb62 @ideo #socents: Need to bring expertise but not impose. Apprenticeship model best--people learn before becoming agents of change. @SallyOsberg #socents=not just the development paradigm   but about building indigenous infrastructure. @SallyOsberg @cwclub #socents have to clever about figuring out models that are better &amp; cheaper--@RogerLMartin @tceb62 @ideo @cwclub #socents are fighting trad'l int'l aid paradigm. @Pih trained city health workers &amp; achieved huge TB-cure rates &amp; shifted @WHO. @SallyOsberg Transparencey &amp; managing externalities is mperative...@VW dealt w/this.

Look at @Unilever @PaulPolman. @SallyOsberg @ideo @cwclub Great e.g.: @HeroRATs used rats to de-mine at very low cost...how Mozambique was able to declare itself mine-free last year. @RogerLMartin Andrew Youn @OneAcreFund piloted an idea w/a few 100 farms. Scaled it w/lower cost per acre while driving down costs. @SallyOsberg @cwclub #socents requires much innovation. Myth that these innovations spring fully formed. They have to try &amp; fail a lot.  @tceb62 @ideo @cwclub Scale=contested term‚Ä¶Not about size of org or budget....The scale Imazon is able to achieve comes through its work w/govt @SallyOsberg #socentship=another v/ powerful tool to add to the resources &amp; mandates of govt &amp; biz to achieve large-scale change @RogerLMartin @cwclub #socents take best of both worlds--govt &amp; business--to create their models for large-scale change--@SallyOsberg #getbeyondbetter @cwclub We felt #socentship had evolved enough that we could create more clarity about what #socents are &amp; how they create solutions @RogerLMartin Excited to be watching @timbrown @ideo interviewing @RogerLMartin &amp; @SallyOsberg @cwclub about #socentship and #getbeyondbetter!

Something you can piggyback? #socents are not unlike unconditional cash transfers  empowering people directly. @SallyOsberg @UW #socent see their expertise as going directly to those who have greatest stake in those problems being solved.  @SallyOsberg @UWFosterSchool #socents can act as R&amp;D for #SDGs--all 17 with 169 indicators. @SallyOsberg  w/ the awesome Emer Dooley @uw We saw the need for someone to shed a light on #socent which led to our invest/connect/celebrate strategy @SallyOsberg #socent have been deeply engaged in developing #SDGs over last 5 years  including #childmarriage #landrights @SallyOsberg Bill Foege cracked the code on smallpox w/circle vaccinations. A transformational @UW alum. @SallyOsberg w/Emer Dooley #getbeyondbetter Extremism  terrorism  migration are complex problems  not a question of scale but understanding the complexity first. @SallyOsberg @UW These big problems are outstripping us. #socents need to identify the markers along the way to equilibrium change. @SallyOsberg @UW .@SallyOsberg on the 3 tensions which led @mollyjmelching @Tostan to her successful community empowerment program 20 yrs later We hold #socents to higher standard &amp; ask a lot of them including raising sustained funds. @SallyOsberg @UW https://t.co/SVTEKIvN0t #socents must understand the eco model contributing to the status quo. @HeroRATs is great e.g @SallyOsberg @UW https://t.co/mgQFQi7lXB We defined #socent as driving equilibrium change. @SallyOsberg in conversation w Emer Dooley @UWFosterSchool https://t.co/cVUCBm6Teq .@HeroRATs rat can demine for a quarter of the cost of a dog  can do more hectares.

An impt Q &amp; just trying to figure that out ourselves @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015 Yes we have set the bar really high and yes that means that some #socents will fail. @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015 In the epilogue of the book we are very clear that the stories we include are very much works in progress. @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015 How successfully #socents unlock the potential of govts is one of the things that surprised me the most--@SallyOsberg #GWConf2015 What surprised me was how much effective #socent involves working effectively w/government. @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015 Understanding context=critical. @tostan Molly Melching came 2 the #humanrights framework w/ affected communities @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015 You cannot get rid of #FGC if people most vested don‚Äôt have alternatives. @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015 The #socent has to understand the economics that give rise to the status quo. @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015 The women @MollyJMelching is working w have no clue that they have rights. The change comes from community-based ed @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015 The #socent understands cultural context is key. In the book re: foot binding ending  it was partially because of reformers inside. S Osberg The paradigm of development is in need of a paradigm shift. @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015 Figuring out the mechanisms for scale is the hallmark of scale for #socent.  @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015 #socents need to focus on replicability &amp; scalability if they hope to transform an unjust equilibrium--@SallyOsberg #GWConf2015 As you have looked at 100s of #socent what besides a big idea have you recognized in them?  @MauraLONeill to @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015 Distinguishing hallmark of #socent is that they set up a new equilibrium; they are ambitious @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015 Once we landed on the term #socent  @jeffskoll and I said  yes  that's what we want to do. @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015 You @sallyosberg pioneered discipline of #socentship--@MauraLONeill at #GWConf2015 .@SallyOsberg @MauraLONeill keynote begins #GWConf2015 https://t.co/iJyOKtpxRJ Talk #socent w @SallyOsberg now #GWConf2015 in the lobby and pick up her book! https://t.co/AUo8nHHb4u .@Tableau is using #SDGs to have employees vote on which areas their foundation is going to fund. #GWConf2015 At #GWConf2015?

How many funders have tried to fund a network? #GWConf2015 A: Failure involves a change of strategy.

Tell Congress: #NoRiders https://t.co/p6kynenWpa Restricting women‚Äôs health is unpopular with voters ‚Äî that‚Äôs why they have to sneak this and other bad policy in a budget bill #NoRiders If members of Congress want to pass these policy riders  they should do it the right way ‚Äî not as a stealth tactic. #NoRiders Extremists with long records of opposing women‚Äôs health care are pushing these dangerous riders. #NoRiders It‚Äôs wrong for Congress to use must-pass bills that could shut down our govt to make sweeping policy changes w/o debate. #NoRiders Policy riders mean there is no real debate on the issues. To be clear  these riders could not pass on their own. #NoRiders #CleanBudget NOW! Policy riders try to circumvent the democratic process and Americans deserve better ‚Äî they deserve a #CleanBudget. #NoRiders Extremists with long records of opposing women‚Äôs health care are pushing these dangerous riders. #NoRiders #CleanBudget Over 200 organizations are calling for #NoRiders so we can avoid a #shutdown and fund critical programs. #cleanbudget Since extremists were unable to cut patients from care at PP on their own  they are trying to sneak it into the budget instead. #NoRiders The PP rider would limit access to #birthcontrol  #familyplanning  and #abortion. We should expand access NOT limit. #NoRiders Confused about what a policy rider is? It's policy attached to a spending bill that shouldn't be there. #NoRiders https://t.co/Pq3u5bJhrO A #CleanBudget matters to PP because millions would lose access to critical health care services. #NoRiders #StandWithPP Volunteers Ann &amp; Grace Toll in India Jaipur Health Care and Elephant rescue program.   https://t.co/WpPqDad40V https://t.co/iSJWBC9Q6S Volunteers Ann &amp; Grace Toll in India Jaipur Health Care and Elephant rescue program.    https://t.co/WpPqDad40V https://t.co/Ns38q0G2dJ https://t.co/c15bUKvH3z Review Volunteer Lisa Nunez in Ghana Kasoa at the Orphanage program February - March 2016.  1.
