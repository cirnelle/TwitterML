And touchdown! Welcome home @StationCDRKelly  officially back on Earth after spending a #YearInSpace. https://t.co/vmfGJfCRpA Happy #Valentine's Day.

Beer  yes. Hard liquor  yes. But not wine. In @BatmanvSuperman  the question remains  would the @realDonaldTrump deport Superman for being an illegal alien in the USA? In @BatmanvSuperman  I've gotta side with Superman. He’s a space alien from an exoplanet. In astrophysics  that’s how we roll Met Superman a few years ago at the Hayden Planetarium. I helped him find Krypton. A very nice man. https://t.co/OYS7oy91Zj Not that anybody asked  but Gregorian calendar rules unintentionally prevent eclipses from ever occurring on Easter Sunday FYI: Tonight is the first full Moon after the March equinox. By Gregorian calendar rules  the Sunday that follows is Easter. Happy 10th birthday Twitter. Note however  that the trending #LoveTwitter hashtag grossly overstates my emotions for you. Equinox is “Equal Night” in Latin  but refraction in Earth’s atmosphere adds minutes of extra sunshine at sunrise &amp; sunset. Happy March Equinox to all residents of planet Earth: First day of Spring North of the Equator;  First day of Autumn  South. Happy Saint Patrick's day  President Barack O'Bama. Mother Nature has been genetically modifying organisms for nearly four-billion years. Farmers for ten-thousand years. Happy Pi-day to all. Posted my best Pi-tweets a year ago. So today  I’ll just wish a happy 137th Birthday to Albert Einstein. People who are anti-Trump are actually anti-Trump supporters — they oppose free citizens voting for the @realDonaldTrump. If you have a gene for celibacy  you didn’t inherit it. If there were ever a species for whom sex hurt  it surely went extinct long ago. I occasionally wonder whether the entire Universe is nothing more than a snow-globe on the living room mantle of an Alien. I also recreationally consume large quantities of dihydrogen monoxide. On the street  I pay up to $2 000 per megagram for it. Before every tweet  I take deep hits of gaseous cocktails comprised of 78% N2 and 21% O2. A long-revered elixir of life. I’m simultaneously flattered and disturbed when  after posting various tweets  people tweet back wondering if I’m on drugs. The closest thing to fatally passing through a portal into another dimension is when fish get yanked out of water  then eaten I hear that the flat-Earth movement may be gaining momentum all around the globe. Maybe Wolves also love riding in cars &amp; hanging their heads out the window  but my sense is that they’d rather eat the driver Who'd have thought altering Wolf genes to create Dogs would imbue delight for riding in cars with their head out the window. Welcome back to Earth  Scott Kelly. After a year in orbit  Relativity says you’re 1/100 sec younger than you’d otherwise be. With my 5 000 000th follower  I reaffirm that it’s an honor and a privilege to rub your geek underbellies in the Twitterverse Who would Jesus vote for? To him walls  wealth  &amp; torture are non-starters  so probably the Jewish New Yorker from Vermont. Don’t like Leap Days? We could instead wait 28 years and insert a “Leap Week”.  Or 112 years and insert a “Leap Month”. The Leap Day is misnamed. We’re not leaping anywhere. The calendar is simply  and abruptly  catching up with Earth’s orbit Earth takes nearly 365 1/4 days to orbit the Sun. Bank the fraction. Every 4 years add a whole day back to the neediest month Welcome Twitterverse  to the 105th leap day of the Gregorian Calendar... Follow me only if you seek hodgepodge brain droppings of an intellectually restless astrophysicist. You’ve been forewarned. Exterminators: The only profession in which you put yourself out of business by being really good at your job. One's quest in life should not solely be the search for answers. Why not find pleasure in posing the questions themselves. Let's just confess that our best 4D portal  through which products are transported  is the drive-thru window at McDonalds. Maybe what I really want is wormhole-shipping. Buy something online. A 4D portal opens and a person hands you the product. I wonder if workplaces contain too many bosses basking in compliments given by people who rely on them for their paychecks. I wonder what Cannibals &amp; Aztecs would say  watching civilized people eat symbolic hearts of loved ones on Valentine’s Day. From Venus? Then you’re Venusian. But the proper term is Venereal. Unfortunately Doctors nabbed it before Astrophysicists did Venus is the Roman goddess of love &amp; sexuality. And so medical doctors assigned Venereal - “of Venus” to all related diseases 1916: Einstein predicts Gravity Waves. 1917: He lays the foundation for Lasers. 2016: Gravity Waves discovered using Lasers. If you never make mistakes then you are not on the frontier of discovery  for there is where mistakes are made all the time. Today is the first New Moon after Jan  21sr. Happy New Year to Chinese people and all who choose to be Chinese for a day. I wonder what Referees look like to Zebras. If Earth rotated 10x faster in the opposite direction then Coriolis forces would’ve helped the @Panthers make that Field Goal A triumph of Arabic numerals:  After forty-nine Super Bowls enumerated by Roman Numerals  we hashtag #SB50 and not #SBL If #SB50’s football field were a cosmic timeline  then cavemen to present day spans a turf-blade's thickness in the end-zone. Every day where someone could have made a discovery but cultural or political forces impede it  is a sad day for civilization “Look at that  you son of a bitch." https://t.co/JyeiOV7lgv In science  when human behavior  enters the equation  things go nonlinear. That's why Physics is easy and Sociology is hard. Sad Banana. https://t.co/QNx4xv51co It is time: Just re-watched Ridley Scott’s 1982 film Blade Runner. FYI: Three of the Replicants have inception dates in 2016. Dear @bobatl  as an astrophysicist I don’t rap  but I know people who do. This one has my back: https://t.co/BbMi4tzHLz The Cosmos is knowable. When childhood curiosity persists as an adult  it inoculates against others telling you what to think Seedless grapes. Seedless oranges. Seedless watermelons. All good. My vote for the next fruit to invent: Seedless pomegranate Curious how we’re more like to bond with one another based on what we believe is true rather than on what is objectively true With Lotteries funding State education budgets  the best way to sustain them is to NOT teach probability&amp;statistics in school A Cinematic Hypothesis:  The more Film Festivals that a movie wins  the fewer guns  chase scenes  &amp; explosions it contains. I wonder if some forms of creativity can only be generated by a Space Oddity that Falls to Earth. RIP #DavidBowie (1947-2016) This Wednesday morn  are you early to rise? Then look East. The Crescent Moon joins Venus &amp; Saturn. Afloat in dawn skies. Space aliens would surely think it odd that one way humans express affection is the simultaneous exchange of saliva. January 2nd / 3rd :  Merry Perihelion to all. The time of the year where Earth  in its oval orbit  passes closest to the Sun. To all those who reckon time on the Gregorian Calendar - Happy New Year!  (FYI:  January 1 is astronomically  insignificant.) True Science Literacy is less about what you know  and more about how your brain is wired for processing information. There's nothing you can ever tell scientists about the natural world that will hurt their feelings. Christmas Full Moon tonight.  Happens  on average  about once every thirty years. Same for every other day of the month. FYI:  By the end of the Twelve Days of Christmas song  your home is crammed with 23 flying Birds and 50 hyperactive Humans. Male &amp; female Reindeer grow antlers  but males lose them in winter. All Santa’s reindeer  Rudolph too  are therefore female. If people left carrots  celery  &amp; hot tea for Santa on the table rather than milk &amp; cookies  I bet he’d be much  much thinner As Earth warms  and Arctic ice melts  Santa will lose his habitat too. Soon we’ll see photos of him clutched to an ice floe. All this talk about Polar Bears suffering with Global Warming -- nobody thinks about Santa  the Arctic’s most famous resident Merry Christmas to the world’s Christians  and to all the non-Christians who celebrate Christmas just for the heaven of it. December 21 / 22: Happy Summer Solstice to 15% of all Humans and 100% of free Penguins who dwell in the Southern Hemisphere. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens  the Storm Troopers still run as though they’re carrying a full load of poop in their diapers. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens  BB-8  a smooth rolling metal spherical ball  would have skidded uncontrollably on sand. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens  BB-8 is waaaaay cuter than R2D2. Recent evidence indicates that Earth is indeed bi-polar  as we’ve always suspected. I was once anti-biotic. But lately I've been more pro-biotic after reading more about their culture. There is power in Knowledge  but there is greater power in Wisdom “We all came from the sea”  — JFKennedy (1962).  Back when US politicians understood basic Biology. As climate change reshapes the World’s coastlines  rich people lose their second homes. Poor people lose their only homes. Odd that we live in a world where even objective truths count as controversial subjects. The cutest thing ever  in the history of the universe. https://t.co/cStMjxX8uW There is nothing in the US Constitution that protects you from being offended by the truth. Odd that dangerous travel alerts increase when military actions are in progress that are intended to make us all feel safer. I wonder why nobody has ever called pre-historic cave paintings Graffiti. Maybe that’s precisely what it was back then. Now that robots move their limbs smoothly and with grace  I wonder how we’re supposed to imitate them on the dance floor. There are no right or wrong opinions  unless you have invalidated yours for having ignored facts that conflict with them. FYI: The year 2015 contains three "Friday the 13ths”.  Happens once per decade or so. One or two is more typical in a year. 3 400: Americans who died by Terrorism since 2001  3 400: Americans who died by household Firearms since five weeks ago. 400 000: Americans who died fighting in World War II.  400 000: Americans who died by household Firearms since 2001 1.4 Million: Americans who died in all Wars fought since 1776.  1.4 Million: Americans who died via household Guns since 1968 After several Steven Segal films in a row  you'd think bad guys would know to avoid rooms that contain both him &amp; a PoolTable Odd that politicians who change their mind are often criticized by those who don’t  as though ossified thoughts were a virtue The actual Sun (as a Jack-o-Lantern) wishes everyone on Earth a Happy Halloween. (via @NASASunEarth) https://t.co/jheDVwb9mI I'm thinking somebody should invent black bleach  which would get white stains out of black garments. When a Doctor’s prognosis is bad  we want to seek a second opinion. But when a prognosis is good we’re somehow okay with it. I fear a future in which Autocorrect achieves consciousness  becomes our texting overlord  and destabilizes civilization. Energy rises as Velocity squared. So Patricia's 200mph winds are nearly 50% more destructive than 1992 Andrew's 165mph winds. Sustained 200mph hurricane winds are sufficient to strip the bark from trees that are not otherwise snapped from their base. Because you know I’m all about that data  ‘bout that data. No trouble. I’m all about that data  ‘bout that data. No trouble. The 1989 film “BackToTheFuture II” foretold life on Oct 21  2015 — Cubs win World Series.

So let’s do this... https://t.co/kWepmtsirX Not that anybody asked  but the Irresistible Force beats the Immovable Object — every time. Today's @Bengals winning OT field goal was likely enabled by a 1/3-in deflection to the right  caused by Earth’s Rotation. CALLING ALL GEEKS:  Must root for @Cubs — to fulfill their Prophesy in "Back the Future II" http://t.co/OPDCb6JTuq #WhenIWasYourAge it was people who were smart  and phones that were dumb. #WhenIWasYourAge James Bond was probably infected with multiple STDs. #WhenMyParentsWereYourAge “In God We Trust" was neither on our money  the Pledge of Allegiance  or the front wall of Congress #WhenIWasYourAge The weather started feeling cold in September. #WhenIWasYourAge America launched its own Astronauts into space — with its own Spaceships. #WhenIWasYourAge We cured diseases and went to the Moon  benchmarking our usage of the word “Awesome." #WhenIWasYourAge Extracting ketchup from its narrow-necked glass bottle occasionally made you question the laws of gravity. #WhenIWasYourAge A photograph lived inside your camera  cloaked in mystery for weeks  until you took exactly 35 more photos. #WhenIWasYourAge Photographs were records of your life experience  and not the life experience itself. The @MartianMovie — where the protagonist survives not on Wit  Prayer  or Hope. but by “Sciencing the Shit" out of everything The @MartianMovie — where you learn all the ways that being Scientifically Literate can save your life. Evidence that the @MartianMovie is fantasy: The USA &amp; China cooperate with one another in Space. Evidence that the @MartianMovie is fantasy: All who make important decisions are scientifically literate. Guns don’t kill people. Bullets kill people. Fired from guns  brandished by people  who shoot you by accident or on purpose. Kudos to @NASANewHorizons for taking us from a fuzzy blip to a face-on closeup of Pluto’s Moon Charon http://t.co/NZIebO5XCg SPACE ALIEN: "Why does your UN have a Security Council?” HUMAN: “Our leaders argue there about how &amp; why we kill one another” Imagine a world where Nations find the search for life in the Universe more interesting than the taking of life on Earth. Ed @Snowden  after discussing everything from Chemistry to the Constitution on #StarTalk  you're a patriot to me. Stay safe. Congratulations to @TrevorNoah tonight. @TheDailyShow's new opening credits now show Earth rotating in the correct direction. Proper uses of the word Super:  Superman  Supernova  Super Duper  Super Bowl  Supercharged  Superconductivity  Super Mario. Resist the Hype: The size of today’s “Super” moon is to next month’s full moon as a 16.07 inch pizza is to a 16.00 inch pizza Attend culinary school. Prepare a delicious dish. People ask what's your secret? The answer is: you attended culinary school. Sept 23: Happy Equinox to all Earthlings. One of only two annual days when the Sun everywhere rises due East &amp; sets due West. If your Personal Beliefs deny what’s objectively true about the world  then they're more accurately called Personal Delusions There's no greater incentive to lie than the threat of punishment for telling the truth. If your body were bolted to the ground when Earth stopped rotating  then your head would snap off  and it would roll due east I’m just sayin' If Earth stopped rotating  everyone not bolted to the ground would fall over and roll due east at the speed of a jet plane. 2015 has the earliest possible MemorialDay &amp; the latest possible LaborDay  granting the longest possible “unofficial" summer. Reminder: Amid the singing &amp; dancing &amp; speeches at @MTV's #VMAs  the actual award is an Astronaut planting a flag on the Moon An informed opinion is never based on somebody else’s opinion  lest you empower others to do your thinking for you. Jupiter is 11x wider than Earth. But Earth is only 5x wider than Pluto.  So Jovians surely demoted us to DwarfPlanet long ago Any time we're impressed by what a non-human animal does  it's simply because we previously underestimated its intelligence. All previous times the Hare beat the Tortoise  nobody wrote a fable about it. The latest Hi-Res image. I told everybody it wasn’t a planet  but nobody listened. (via @DavidBerthod) http://t.co/3m5HNiKyGJ Just an FYI: All table salt is sea salt. Mined salt just happens to come from long-buried  evaporated  prehistoric seas. Roses are Red  Violets are  I suppose  Violet. Well  if you’re not part of the Solution  then you must be part of the Precipitate. A Geeky joke I'm compelled to share: In Chemistry class the cylinders know more than you do because they're already graduated Odd that we select the heads of agencies by who is most qualified. But we select Presidents by whose personality we like best Odd. Those who feel superior are often compelled to tell others  presumably because it’s not otherwise obvious to anyone. After Koalas  Australian animals seem to come in only three varieties: those who want to eat you  inject venom in you  or hop Maybe I just have an active imagination  but I’m still a bit spooked by the wall outlets in Australia: http://t.co/6g9xUnmETm Okay with female deers &amp; drops of golden sun. But always felt that "La" deserved a better identity than "a note to follow So” Full Moon Friday. The second in July. For bad historical reasons we call it a "Blue Moon”. It’s not Blue. It’s not even rare. Ancient Geek Proverb: To be a genius is to be misunderstood. But to be misunderstood is not to be a genius. Dear Twittererse: I am a servant of your curiosity. And it’s a privilege to share with you my cosmic musings in this medium. And yes  over the years  my relationship with Pluto has been strictly Plutonic. The next time anybody asks me about my religion  I think I’ll reply “Geek Orthodox” Dear Pluto  Lookin’ good. But you’re still a Dwarf Planet — get over it. Love  Neil deGrasse Tyson http://t.co/qBBD9feG6e Were it not for @NASA &amp; kindred programs of discovery  I wonder what hope would remain for our species to rise above itself. #PlutoFacts: Pluto would fit comfortably between New York &amp; Dallas. Between Rome &amp; Moscow.  Between Perth &amp; Melbourne. #PlutoFacts:  Earth’s Moon is five times more massive than Pluto.  Get over it. Evidence for global warming comes in many forms. http://t.co/zN3U83ETZH I once showed Pluto to Pluto. He looked delighted. Or maybe that’s his reaction to everything. http://t.co/mhLZ5t7LoN Just an FYI: Pluto and I buried the hatchet a long time ago. And we’ve been pals ever since. http://t.co/zPQNymxVUV Enjoying colorful fireworks tonight? Thank Aluminum Barium Calcium Chlorine Copper Iron Nitrogen Oxygen Sodium &amp; Strontium. The study of the universe is the oldest science  but likely only the second oldest profession. Yes  it’s possible to be a supreme holy figure yet still know what you are talking about regarding the Climate. As I get older  I’ve become more and more intolerant of intolerance. As always  I celebrate my leap seconds with very tiny bottles of champagne. The Moon continually tugs on Earth’s rotation  slowing us down bit by bit. To compensate  Tuesday  June 30 gets a leap second Name-calling is what happens when you desperately want to argue  but you are in fact inarticulate. The day with most sunlight: Happy Summer Solstice to Earth residents north of the equator. Now thru Dec 21 days get shorter. If you're good at BS'ing others  then all it means is that you rarely hang around people who are smarter than you. My favorite line in "The Martian" trailer  uttered by Matt Damon  is “I’m going to have to science the shit out of this.” In 5-billion yrs the Sun will expand &amp; engulf our orbit as the charred ember that was once Earth vaporizes. Have a nice day. Just an FYI: Stepping on an Ant is equivalent to a creature 10 000 times more massive than a Blue Whale stepping on you. From what I have seen of society  the number of people who will tell you what you cannot accomplish in life is limitless. Still distracted by the fact that "The Los Angeles @Angels" baseball team literally translates to "The The Angels Angels" Cool Fact: Helium was discovered on the Sun before it was discovered on Earth. Was thus named for Helios  the Greek Sun god. Given how chubby cherubs are  it's clear their itty bitty wings are aerodynamically useless to them. http://t.co/6NApiDsMc3 Curious fact that those who never fail are also those who never truly succeed. For Algebra Geeks: If the thickness of a pizza is A  and its radius is Z  and pi is just PI  then its volume is V = PIZZA. If the cheese on a 14-inch pizza falls just 1-inch shy of the crust  the pie is missing 30% of the cheese that could be there Odd that pizza is sold by the inch  but consumed by the square-inch. This fact confuses assessment of pricing and toppings. Last one: The Latinized name for Earth is Terra. If you are human "of the Earth" you are Terrable. (Just kidding  Earthlings) From Venus? Then you’re Venusian. But the proper term is Venereal. Unfortunately Doctors nabbed it before Astrophysicists did And it seems to me that any life forms we discover within Jupiter’s icy moon Europa would rightly be called Europeans. Seems to me  if we discover any life forms from the Vega star system (constellation Lyrae) they'd rightly be called Vegans. At The Who concert listening to 71yr old R. Daltrey &amp; 70 yr old P. Townsend sing their lyric "I hope I die before I get old." Thinking the World today is particularly violent? During World War II  an average of 1 000 people were killed per hour I wonder who was the first person to see a bird soaring high above &amp; think it a good idea to capture it and lock it in a cage Curious fact that any time we lose a person who sings the Blues  as we just did in #BBKing  the World becomes a sadder place. Just an FYI: Well-funded Political Action Committees are not buying your vote  they're buying media influence over your vote. When flight attendants say "Cabin is pressurized for your comfort” they mean "so you don't suffocate from oxygen deprivation" Okay to encourage others to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. But if you do  just remember  some people have no boots. If you removed all the arteries  veins  &amp; capillaries from a person's body  and tied them end-to-end  the person will die. Our “Common Sense" is not derived from what is true in Nature but from the limits on how our senses interact with Nature. Try as I might  I cannot resist this geek-laden  lisp-inducing  annual utterance: "May the fourth be with you." The less evidence we have for what we believe is certain  the more violently we defend beliefs against those who don't agree. The total number "What-are-the-odds?" moments that can happen is so large  we should instead think of rare events as common. Seems to me  every day should be Earth Day. Okay to not know. But when you don't know  yet think you know  and wield power in that ignorance  it's a recipe for disaster. If there is a cat Heaven  and if cat Heaven has mice for cats to chase  seems to me that cat Heaven must then be mice Hell. I will neither confirm nor deny that you heard my voice in the @BatmanvSuperman trailer: http://t.co/Ei7HX4z5xl Meteors meet fiery deaths as they plunge through Earth’s atmosphere. So the term “Meteoric Rise” makes no sense whatsoever. If you're curious: First mammals to orbit Earth  in order: Dog  Guinea Pig  Mouse  Russian Human  Chimpanzee  American Human. On #FamilyGuy Brian sweats  But Dogs don’t have sweat glands. I then figured Dogs don’t talk either. So I left that one alone The word “awesome" once described things like Moon landings &amp; cures for disease. Today  it’s an unexpected feature in an App. As we did last year  Ozzie and I wish all Christians (and Bunny lovers) a Happy Easter. http://t.co/4CJ0bocXZZ Another way to look at “Religious Freedom” laws  is that they give you the legal right to make less money. If the Pledge of Allegiance told the truth: http://t.co/Iy5zoyMOls I don't mind trolls. But if you're going to be one  then please try to stay on topic. Ever notice how Vampires &amp; dead people  who sit up in their caskets  do so with a straight back? They must have good abs. Every now and then I get the impression that people would rather react before they think. If I were ever abducted by aliens  the first thing I’d ask is whether they came from a planet where people also deny science. No matter the sports you’ve played  if you’ve ever wrestled you’ll say it’s the hardest thing you’ve ever done.@NCAAWrestling Yup.  They happened today.  Total Solar Eclipse &amp; the March Equinox.

You’re curious -- I can feel it. How many digits of Pi before the numerals 0123456789 appear in sequence? 17 387 594 879 Get your Geek on. Time to fit all the digits of Pi into a single tweet:  Pi in base Pi = 10 Best Pi-Day Ever:  53 minutes &amp; 58 seconds after 6 o’clock  March 14  the year 1592:  3/14/1592; 6:53:58 Enough Pi for everyone:  3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230781640628620899862803482534211706 Ongoing research continues to demonstrate conclusively that your IQ is an excellent predictor of your score on an IQ test. I wonder what a gov’t “Of the people  by the people  &amp; for the people" means given advertising’s power to sway an electorate. If we were honest about shortcomings of human physiology then "optical illusions” would instead be labeled “brain failures”. Untruth in Advertising: “Mega" is the metric prefix for million  so the Mega-millions Lottery should pay trillions of dollars My favorite cold temperature is forty below zero - where Celsius equals Fahrenheit. No need to specify the scale you’re using Would be cool if space aliens landed on Earth and instead asked  “Take me to your common people!" Good education is not what fills your head with facts but what stimulates curiosity. You then learn for the rest of your life You should all know by now that if you accuse me of being a Nerd or a Geek  I’ll simply take it as a compliment and move on. Had to wait in line to renew a Passport allowing me to visit members of my own species across artificially conceived borders. A 50-yd field goal  in the University of Phoenix Stadium  deflects about one-third inch to the right due to Earth's rotation Just an FYI:  A 250 lb football player  running 15 mph  has more kinetic energy than a bullet fired from an AK-47 rifle. Occasionally I wonder what a football game would be like if played by Zombies. Would be slower  but oh so much more violent. Enjoying colorful fireworks in Arizona? Thank Aluminum Barium Calcium Chlorine Copper Iron Nitrogen Oxygen Sodium &amp; Strontium I wonder is Sharks feel sorry for humans because we get only two sets of teeth  rather than unlimited. Not that anybody asked  but the International Space Station travels four miles in 4/5 of a second. I love the smell of the Universe — in the evening. You can neither cajole nor charm the laws of physics into agreeing with you if your ideas aren't based in objective realities Not enough of us reflect on how modern civilization pivots on the discoveries of just a few intellectually restless people. For the Patriots to blame a change in temperature for 15% lower-pressures  requires balls to be inflated with 125-degree air. Chill. Earth is 17 trillion times the mass of Monday’s Asteroid. Same as the Space Shuttle’s launch mass to an eyebrow hair. A big ass-teroid (500 meters) buzz-cuts Earth  Monday  11:19am ET.  But at 3-times the Earth-Moon distance  no need to duck. I dream of a world where the truth is what shapes people's politics  rather than politics shaping what people think is true. Jan 21  2015: The 1989 film “Back to the Future II” showed life on Oct 21  2015. So we’ve got 9 Months to invent Hoverboards. You never see US Citizens that hate to pay Taxes  long to live in places with lower rates  like HongKong  Pakistan  or Russia if I am ever abducted by aliens  I just may be compelled to ask  “Do you have Hoverboards on your home planet?" And you thought 2015 was uninteresting: @JohnAllenPaulos reminds me that in binary  the year is Palindromic: 11111011111 Students who earn straight "A"s in school do so not because of good Teachers but in spite of bad Teachers. Wouldn't it be cool if Zombies &amp; Vampires became human if we bit them first? Somebody needs to test that hypothesis. Happy Hew Year to all on the Gregorian calendar. Today  Earth completes yet another 939 950 000 km journey around the Sun. By 2015  Apollo 11 will be as long ago as 1923 was to the Moon landing itself. And I don’t know what we have to show for it. Although clocks on the Prime Meridian keep "Universal Time"  I’m quite sure Aliens across the actual universe don’t care. Reflections on what became my most retweeted tweet:  https://t.co/hlEH6B3eYU Imagine a world in which we are all enlightened by objective truths rather than offended by them. Santa knows Physics: Of all colors  Red Light penetrates fog best. That's why Benny the Blue-nosed reindeer never got the gig Merry Christmas to all. A Pagan holiday (BC) becomes a Religious holiday (AD). Which then becomes a Shopping holiday (USA). On this day long ago  a child was born who  by age 30  would transform the world. Happy Birthday Isaac Newton b. Dec 25  1642 QUESTION: ThIs year  what do all the world's Muslims and Jews call December 25th? ANSWER: Thursday If we had twelve fingers  there’d be no middle finger to flip at people with whom you’ve run out of words to communicate. December 20  1975: 17 years old  I visited Carl Sagan at Cornell University. His Appt. Book that day. http://t.co/tlWgQwsrqO On some issues  I’m a staunch Conservative — like curtailing greenhouse gas emissions so that we can Conserve the environment Sad over today’s state of the world? During the six years of World War II  an average of 1 000 people were killed — per hour. Aliens  seeing Humans kill over land  politics  religion  &amp; skin color  would surely ask  “What the f*%k is wrong with you?" Just because you can't figure out how ancient civilizations built stuff  doesn't mean they got help from Aliens. #WhenIWasYourAge: Religion was taught in Sunday School  not in your Science Classroom. Times Have Changed: Officer kills an unarmed Black man  spawning National protests. When I grew up  this was just local news. I wonder if Atheists eat at T.G.I. Fridays. Our image of evil space aliens surely derives from a fear that they will treat us just as we treat one another. Odd that drivers of fuel efficient cars often get more green-praise than those who chose to live where they can walk to work. Mysteries of #Interstellar: In this unreal future  they teach unscientific things in science class. Oh  wait. That is real. Mysteries of #Interstellar: Can’t imagine a future where escaping Earth via wormhole is a better plan than just fixing Earth. I wonder if Farm Animals think deep thoughts while standing around doing nothing. I also wonder if they wonder the same of us In #Interstellar: They explore a planet near a Black Hole. Personally  I’d stay as far the hell away from BlackHoles as I can In #Interstellar  if you didn’t understand the plot  there is no published book to help you. In #Interstellar: On another planet  around another star  in another part of the galaxy  two guys get into a fist fight. In #Interstellar: Of the leading characters (all of whom are scientists or engineers) half are women. Just an FYI. Relativity. Gravity. Quantum. Electrodynamics. Evolution. Each of these theories is true  whether or not you believe in them. In #Interstellar: Experience Einstein’s Relativity of Time as no other feature film has shown. Stay calm. Just because Republicans took control over the Senate  doesn't mean Global Warming is any less true than before. If voters thought entirely for themselves  then Political Action Committees &amp; attack-ads would have no influence on elections Proud to be Homo sapiens. A curious species with DNA compelling us to explore  even if doing so puts your own life at risk. Pope Francis announced that he now embraces the science of Evolution &amp; the Big Bang. Hmm. I wonder if he just watched Cosmos? In Court you can win even if ideas you defend are not true.  But in science  Nature is the ultimate judge  jury &amp; executioner I wonder if social media atheists ever use "OMG".  If so  they probably intended to type "OYG". I’m quite sure that Frogs were into Hip-Hop long before the music industry was. I wonder what aliens would think of human biology  upon learning we spend 1/3 of each Earth rotation in a semi-comatose state The objective truths of the world are controversial only to people who are both under-informed and who like to argue. Today’s date is 10 / 10 / 2014.  It’s so rare that it will never happen again. Plants get their energy from the Sun. Herbivores from plants. Carnivores from herbivores. In the end  we're all solar powered I wonder how much talent has evaporated from the world  for lack of ambition to drive it. There are surely problems in the universe so advanced that our human brain cannot see them as problems in need of solution. I think not enough good Hot Chocolate is served in the world.

If your belief system is not founded in an objective reality  you should not be making decisions that affect other people. There are surely problems in the universe so advanced that our human brain cannot see them as problems in need of solution. Would be cool if be our lives  our planet  our solar system  our universe  were part of a data simulation conducted by aliens Some claim the USA is a Christian nation  compelling me to wonder which assault rifle Jesus would choose: the AR-15 or AK-47. Not that anybody asked  but still disgruntled that the “Alphabet Song" has the same melody as “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star”. In any case  I want to live in a world where a chicken can cross the road without anybody questioning its motives. Damn. One mystery solved &amp; another rears its head: Which came first  the chicken salad sandwich or the egg salad sandwich? Just to settle it once and for all: Which came first the Chicken or the Egg? The Egg -- laid by a bird that was not a Chicken Mork from Ork: Rare evidence that aliens can be smart  clever  articulate &amp; funny.  Robin Williams  RIP Genuine “Super”s in the Universe: Super Giant  Supernova  Super Collider  Super Volcano   Superman  Super Mario. July’s full moon is to August's "Super Moon” what a 16.0 inch pizza is to a 16.1 inch pizza. I’m just saying. Seems to me  as long as we don't program emotions into Robots  there's no reason to fear them taking over the world. So much of life is wasted waiting in line: stores  traffic  security  etc. One hour per day sums to 5 yrs of your waking life When other mammals get bored  I wonder if they use this free time to contemplate their place in the universe  as humans do. Dracula &amp; other undead people who sleep in coffins must have good abs. They always rise up flat-backed when the casket opens. When a coincidence seems amazing  that's because the human mind isn’t wired to naturally comprehend probability &amp; statistics. If @Comic_Con people ruled the world  the future would be invented daily &amp; warfare would be bar-fights with toy light-sabers. CosmicMystery: Why dogs can smell aromas from far away  yet are compelled to sniff each other’s butt at a fraction of an inch I wonder what Rugby players think every time they see a Soccer player crying in pain from being grazed by another player. Never liked the term “nonfiction".  The truth should have its own word  and not be shackled to its antonym. Enjoying colorful fireworks tonight? Thank Aluminum Barium Calcium Chlorine Copper  Iron Nitrogen Oxygen Sodium &amp; Strontium. Humans kill one another so often  for all reasons including none  I wonder how we'd treat a peaceful alien who visited Earth. When aliens arrive on Earth &amp; study our web infrastructure  they'd likely conclude cute cats are the engines of our Internet. After filming the #CosmosFinale  @SethMacFarlane &amp; I knocked back a cold one on the crescent Moon. http://t.co/pTPFhcI1Hc Cosmos was a labor of love  an offer of hope  and a vision of a future that could be. Thanks for joining my SpaceTime Odyssey Between scenes on #Cosmos. Hadrian’sVilla. Surely the cover art for my nonexistent album of love songs http://t.co/e2CkPiUrzD #Cosmos was conceived not to tell the you what is true  but to share how we have come to learn what is true. Never presume that just because you disagree with an idea that you must be correct. I'm quite sure I'm the last person in the universe to have learned that RACECAR spelled backwards is RACECAR Parents who are no longer curious are not as alive as the children they raise who are. Hit 2-million followers earlier today—even after reminding people I’m an astrophysicist. A sure sign that science is trending If we all had twelve fingers  I wonder if Moses would have brought twelve commandments down from Mt. Sinai instead of ten. I may be biased  but wouldn’t it be cool if “Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey” redefined the meaning of Reality TV. If you're told what's the same but see what’s different  or told what's different but see what’s the same  you’re a scientist The Soviet KGB would have admired all the ways America -- land of the free -- now conducts surveillance on its own citizens. May the 4th be with you all. Earth Day was a week ago. But when you think about it  every day should be Earth Day — until we live on more than one planet. Not that anybody asked  but when the Moon is in the 7th house  &amp; Jupiter aligns with Mars  nothing will happen because of it. The limits on your enlightenment come not from the age you stopped going to school but from the age you stopped being curious Ozzie and I wish all Christians and Bunny lovers of the world a Happy Easter. http://t.co/st6rBRnRA8 USA to Russia: “We’re imposing sanctions on you!! But please still allow us on your Soyuz so we can reach our Space Station" If your sentence contains the word "Hope" then you've confessed no control over the outcome you're hoping for. Evidence humans are smarter than cats: We don't chase dots on the floor made by lasers. What the world needs now  is a little more rhyme and a little more reason. Since mega- is the metric prefix for a million  "Mega Millions" state lottery jackpots should really be paying trillions. If our blood used Copper instead of Iron  turning it green  I wonder what color we would have made stop lights &amp; stop signs. When the universe lands in a GQ shoot  you know science is trending in the world. http://t.co/9peq4pkAaL For those who don’t remember when they last saw a TV show on a TV:  The full COSMOS premiere on line: http://t.co/RsLprTTRwI GEEK DILEMMA: Cosmos airs the same time as Walking Dead. I may be biased  but I’m watching the Universe &amp; DVR’ing the Zombies What would aliens say if told that Earthlings shift clocks by an hour to fool themselves into thinking there's more sunlight I'm beginning to feel the Gravity of the situation The Moon Song just performed during the Oscars was either sung in the Southern Hemisphere  or the rising Moon was upside down A @BarackObama sandwich-selfie at the @WhiteHouse  earlier today with Bill Nye @TheScienceGuy http://t.co/rEdWtoh2zx You are not biased any time you ever speak the truth. When I shop for fruit &amp; melons I like to hold a grape next to a cantaloupe &amp; think of Earth next to Jupiter. Then I eat Earth Without a space program that discovers  tracks &amp; deflects killer asteroids  our extinction is assured by one. Have a nice day If 335lb Terrance Knighton of the Broncos hits you at 10 mph  it's 40x the momentum of a 12 gauge shotgun blast to your chest Scientology &amp; Astrology.

A shout out to Canadians for putting your versatile robotic Space Arm on your $5 note: http://t.co/0AC6mutvDT Your State taxes at work. http://t.co/QmMNG4d3Ec I think the winner of the Pro Bowl should play the winner of the Super Bowl in a new event called the Super Duper Bowl. Posted This Week: @StarTalkRadio's - Season 4 "Cosmic Queries" Time capsule [part 2] – On iTunes &amp; http://t.co/hVRRimnlbb Some educators  who are quick to say "These students just don't want to learn”  should instead be saying "I suck at my job”. January 4. Merry Perihelion to all. Earth  in its oval orbit  is closer to the Sun today than on any other day of the year. Would be cool if one year Macy's splayed "Question!" across their front entrance instead of "Believe" http://t.co/pOgIV6wUF3 Born on this day  long ago  was a man who showed us all a way to know the Cosmos. Isaac Newton  Dec 25  1642 Lincolnshire  UK Dec 24  2013. 45th anniversary of @NASA's seminal Earthrise photo. Taken as Apollo 8 orbited the Moon. http://t.co/uKcHIqecHj Need to cry  but don't want others to know? Look up to the stars. Your tears won't fall  and the cosmos will make you smile. Holiday derives from Holy Day. So it's etymologically under-informed to assert that "Happy Holidays" does not reference God. I like new ideas &amp; old wines. New software &amp; old books. Water fountains &amp; fountain pens. New discoveries &amp; old friends. If a football field were a timeline of cosmic history  cavemen to now spans the thickness of a blade of grass in the end zone What would aliens say when told Earthlings shift clocks twice a year to fool themselves into thinking there's more sunlight. We spend more time forcing students to learn than we do motivating them to learn in the first place. The question -- What would Pinocchio's nose do if he declared  "My nose is about to grow!"? -- has no answer in his universe I love the smell of the Universe in the morning. Based on comments from winning players  it's remarkable how much time God spends to help athletes defeat their opponents. Mysteries of #Gravity: Why we enjoy a SciFi film set in make-believe space more than we enjoy actual people set in real space Just because you don't agree with something  doesn't mean that what you don't agree with is wrong. In 5-billion years the Sun will expand &amp; engulf our orbit as the charred ember that was once Earth vaporizes.

The US objects to killing people with chemicals  yet our system of capital punishment is based on death by lethal injection. If you need to invoke your academic pedigree or job title for people to believe what you say  then you need a better argument The human body is an assembly of chemicals  as is all food &amp; all medicine. So what we label as a drug is a social construct. Moon Landing: July 20  1969. No other act of human exploration ever laid a plaque saying "We Come In Peace For All Mankind" Unlike Florida today  only if threatened by another Gun did "Wild West" codes of conduct allow you to shoot another person.

Just Posted: @StarTalkRadio  Cosmic Queries Edition "Grab Bag" with cohost @chucknicecomic on iTunes &amp; http://t.co/18M4Y2bJXK The perennially hyped name "Super Moon" insults the legacy of Superman  Super Volcanoes  Supernovae  and even Super Mario. The good thing about Science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it. Things you might say if you flunked Intro Probability &amp; Statistics: "Everything happens for a reason." Not that anybody asked  but the symbol "lb" for pound comes from an abbreviation of the constellation Libra  the scales. Advice to Students:  When choosing a career  consider jobs where the idea of a vacation from it repulses you. Odd that for many people  the less data that support their beliefs the more ardently they'll defend them  even w/ their lives [May 8  2013]  Happy Fibonacci day: 0 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - [ 5 - 8 - 13 ] - 21 - 34 - 55 - 89 - 144 …   Next one is Aug 13  2021 Iron Man -  A superhero whose super powers derive entirely from his own intellect -- a mastery of physics &amp; engineering. Not that anybody asked  but I object to religion in science classrooms not because it's religion but because it's not science There's no crime in being ignorant. Problems arise when people who  don't know they're ignorant rise to power. Golfers want silence when hitting stationary balls at their feet. Baseball batters  in screaming crowds  hit 90 mph fastballs When Students cheat on exams it's because our School System values grades more than Students value learning. The economic battle-crry of "Buy American" should instead be "Buy the Best"  thereby compelling Americans to make the best. What's next in America -- A movement to denounce the theory of gravity because it makes people heavy? Urges to deny facts that conflict w/ your politics or religion thwart efforts to embrace reality &amp; make a better world for it I love the smell of the Universe in the morning. The best colleges admit only successful  students  offering no evidence the college itself forged the students' later success Most who fear genetically altered food are unaware that nearly all food has been genetically altered via artificial selection **Pi are not round  Pi 'r' squared**.  Happy Pi-day (3.14) to all those who numerically write their months before their dates Security signs that begin with "For your protection..." essentially end with "...we will restrict freedoms &amp; invade privacy" As best as I can tell  the only people who are fully metric-fluent in America are scientists and drug traffickers. You don't need to be a scientist to know Earth's age or that life evolved.

Past & current NASA programs inspire kids. #NASAFuture Eltayeb "Misconception that the brightest students will make it on their own. They often don't. Need challenges before them" #NASAFuture Eltayeb focused on K-12 students  developed program called Center for Future Engineers targeted to kids 6th-12th grade. #NASAFuture Bowden realized in college that engineers do more than drive trains. excited in to see engineering textbooks with cool pictures! If you have questions on NASA and Science  Technology Engineering mathematics (STEM) education please reply to @NASA_Technology #NASAFuture Honored to have Michael Lach from Dept of Ed moderating  Dr Bowden (UMD)  Dr. Eltayeb (Frostberg) Ms. Bardenhagen (teacher) and @Astro_Flow We will be back at 2:45 with the education panel. Zephyr tech also helped monitor the miners in Chile while they were awaiting rescue. #NASAFuture Questions for the panel from the twitterverse? We are talking about benefits of investing in technology #NASAFuture Blankenship (UMD) "NASA is probably one of the best things the country has ever done" #NASAFuture Hertzfeld "Unquantifiable ways tech investments help:quality of life  process improvement  mgmt. innovation  knowledge  stim new industry." Hertzfeld "Investment in knowledge and tech are building blocks. What is spent in the past continues on in the future." Hertzfeld "we don't capture how government spending turns into return. gov is not like business. Gov't is mission oriented. #NASAFuture Zephyr's work with NASA has opened doors in commercial market with athletes  public safety  consumers. #NASAFuture Gentleman-Zephyr Tech created bioharness- measures heart rate  breathing rate  etc. NASA used to help Astros train  prevent motion sickness. Dr. Blankenship of UMD helped create a satellite based search & rescue system funded by NASA. Helped rescue Abby Sunderland and ~28k others. Doswell (Juxtopia  LLC) is an innovator from Baltimore who also directs Google Lunar X Prize Jurban team comprised completely of students. Back live in College Park  MD with the  #NASAFuture Forum with the Technology Investments and Innovation Panel. Www.NASA.gov/ntv Frostburg State University is showing their balloon sat capsule. It has GPS  accelerators  sensors. http://yfrog.com/h84whuwj The #NASAFuture forum will take a break until 1:30 ET We will come back and talk about benefits from tech and investments. Busalacchi talking about how fundamental observations have improved our understanding of our Earth system Pierce "next gen of earth science being flown for test on suborbital" talking about IceSat and Icebridge http://t.co/0XM2Ll5 #NASAFuture Q: from audience on why NASA tech that could reduce need to go to the doctor  is not prevalent (i.e. Remote monitoring of patients.) Abdalati "with all that amazing discoveries Hubble produced  we forget how much it cost." value comes w/tech advances  jobs created. Pierce: Suborbital is one of best the training grounds for the agency. Students learn to test  validate projects. #NASAFuture David Pierce Since earliest days of the agency  NASA's suborbital platforms (balloons  sounding rockets) have enabled dreams. #NASAFuture Science panel up....looking to engage with Audience and twitter! Send your questions to @NASA_Technology #NASAFuture re: open source innovation Byrne "prediction markets are powerful b/c they aggregate ideas quickly." For those who don't know  the SBIR and STTR programs provide funding to Small Biz and academic partners (STTR) to jump start new ideas. Parrish "Innovation is a rejection of the status quo." #NASAFuture O'shea All explorers go through lack of success. #NASAFuture Comment from audience...many innovations came from those who were rejected (I.e Gates  Einstein) Need to reward the creative. #NASAFuture McNutt of John Hopkins APL "NASA promotes innovation through competition...best idea wins." #NASAFuture Barbe of MD Tech Enterprise Develop and support tech based startups from our research labs...turn into opportunities. #NASAFuture O'Shea of UMD "nobody ever received an education from the classroom." outside class  multidisciplinary learning important. #NASAFuture NASA's Parrish on NASA's programs to inspire innovation.  Example: @NASAPrize reaches citizen inventors w/ challenges. #NASAFuture Starting back up again live on NASAtv. www.nasa.gov/ntv #NASAfuture Chris showing the #NASAfuture forum an autonomous H2O vehicle UMD students built for competition. http://yfrog.com/ke9dwykj We are going to take a break until 10:15 Edwards "we need to make sure NASA has the resources that match the vision." #NASAfuture Rep. Edwards talking about her early career @NASA_Goddard. Rep. Edwards has joined the forum. "A Nation is only as strong as its investments in technology." Abdalati "Be the inspiration  create a movement  invest wisely in our future. Dreams of today will be the success of tomorrow." #NASAFuture Abdalati "you heard it from Leland. Even nuckleheads can be inspirational! #NASAFuture Melvin "what do we uniquely have to inspire the future?" @Astro_Flow  #NASAFuture Leland Melvin (@Astro_flow) reflecting on his childhood and the things that influenced him for his career path. #NASAFuture Braun "21st century will be won by those who create...innovate..." #NASAFuture Braun "We make technology investments to enable exploration...contributes to economy...staying at cutting edge" #NASAFuture Chief Technologist @Bobby_Braun talking about why he loves being affiliated w/ NASA. "we are always trying to outdo ourselves." #NASAFuture Leshin "As SHE shakes that red soil out of her boots..." talking of first human on Mars. #NASAFuture Leshin "pushing the boundaries is part of who we are as human beings." #NASAfuture The NASA panel includes @Astro_Flow @Bobby_Braun  Laurie Leshin and Waleed Abdalati. Bolden "when your trying to reach high points  you have to have something to stand on" #NASAFuture Bolden "ISS represents dreams that have not been fulfilled yet." #NASAFuture Bolden "we are very optimistic about the future" #NASAFuture Admin Charlie Bolden appreciating the leadership of Rep. Donna Edwards and bipartisan support from Congress. #NASAFuture O'Shea "NASA stands at a critical juncture...will it continue to inspire?" #NASAFuture We are live in College Park!

Now we start getting closer. RT My orbit around the Sun is like being on a roller coaster. As I get "higher" I slow down  then plunge "down" getting faster &amp; faster. 1/2 Comet ISON is heading in from the orbit of Jupiter  which is roughly where I am now. It'll be huge just before I reach my target. #wasntme A new comet has been discovered  and looks like it's going to be a biggie! (possibly as bright as the moon). http://t.co/il6IXEzC Did I mention I've reached the orbit of Jupiter? I can't see him though  he's on the other side of the Sun right now. Mission day: 3107. Distance to target: 55 million km. I'm going to reach the top of my rollercoaster (furthest distance from the Sun) in early October. My orbit around the Sun is a bit like being on a roller coaster.

Happy birthday #Rosetta! Mission day: 2914 - Distance to target: 84 million km It may be Friday evening  but my sims engineers are still hard at work! http://t.co/LGvONaSb You can find a nice picture I took of Mars on the DLR website - http://t.co/g3irWlED -- please note the image is © CIVA/Philae/ESA (3/3) One of those reasons is that my cameras don't point in the same direction. So if OSIRIS can see something  I can't! (2/3) I don't take as many pictures as OSIRIS does  aboard my mothership #Rosetta. There are several reasons for this. (1/3) I am now "just" 90 million km from the comet I'm going to land on in 2014 (and getting closer all the time now) I'll do it first though ;) RT @SETIInstitute Harpooning a comet? NASA’s planning to do just that! http://t.co/wko6ToXz Sad to see the end of Phobos Grunt  she had a number of instruments (and teams) closely related to my own. We were cousins  in a way. Happy Friday the 13th  Earthlings! Especially astronomy teacher @skyeman1 -- my 350th follower! Please say hi to your students for me! lots of my scientists are congregating in the Netherlands this week  for the #Rosetta Science Operations Working Group meeting This is where my engineers will be doing tests for the next few years to prepare for 2014 - my Ground Reference Model http://t.co/zqRKCqfr ISIC - International Space Innovation Centre http://t.co/jk7fXpGN If Concorde was still flying  and went in a straight line through the Sun (and could fly in space)  it would need over 46 years to reach me. I'm currently on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth  almost 900 million km (or 550 million miles) away. 1/2 #PhilaeThursday 4 years ago today  my mothership and I were (wrongly) identified as a Earth-threatening asteroid. Today a real 'roid flies past safely! My distance from the Earth doesn't just increase  because we're not traveling in straight lines. Sometimes the Earth "catches up" a little. Comet tails point away from the Sun because they're not caused by movement  but by the solar wind & radiation pressure. When I'm operating each Tx unit is switched on hourly (alternately) by a hardware mechanism to ensure they WILL be turned on (2/2) Being able to communicate with the #Rosetta orbiter is vital to my mission. So I have 2 transmitters and 2 receivers. #PhilaeThursday (1/2) I'm going to land on a #comet  but I'm a robot. Landing humans on an #asteroid will be much harder - http://t.co/QdeGfqSX via @esa Comets are one of the few things you can shoot with a harpoon and then expect people to say "Great! Shoot it again!" #PhilaeThursday I be chasin' an icy beast through the black sea of space  and when I get in range  I'll be firing me harpoons.

But I'm all snuggled up in lots of blankets. 40 layers of blankets  in fact! I weigh about 100Kg but the gravity at my destination (a comet) will be so low  I'll weigh the equivalent of just 4 noodles (2g) on Earth I weigh about 100Kg. At its peak of activity in 2002/3  my comet was pumping out approx 60Kg of dust PER SECOND.

I'm too far away to take a photo though! RT @astro_paolo Cologne  Germany http://flic.kr/p/9Gv8pp Subsystem #3 is "CDMS"  my flight computer. It's full of redundant systems to be fault tolerant  and runs a unique OS. #PhilaeThursday My anchoring subsystem has 2 harpoons to hold me down securely on the comet's surface after landing #PhilaeThursday My ADS thruster can also give me a small push towards the comet during descent  reducing the descent time. #PhilaeThursday This is because the comet is so small  its gravity is very weak. I don't want to bounce off into space back after landing! #PhilaeThursday Unlike landing on a planet where thrusters may be used to slow down a lander  my thruster will push me down ONTO the comet! #PhilaeThursday The first of my subsystems (alphabetically) is the "Active Descent System" or ADS which has a Nitrogen gas thruster. #PhilaeThursday 3 of my 9 subsystems were built using advanced technology from a crashed alien spacecraft. Yes  even spacecraft enjoy #aprilfools day ;-) I have 9 subsystems  and am carrying 10 experiment units. The SS keep me alive  but the expts are the reason I was built. #PhilaeThursday Just added myself to the http://wefollow.com twitter directory under:  #space #comets #spacecraft #spaceflight #spaceship #spaceexploration My scientists and engineers will be gathering in Cologne this week  for the "Operations Working Group" and "Science Working Team" meetings The carbon-fibre rods used to make my legs will soon be used in laser cutting machines http://bit.ly/f4Eg5s #PhilaeThursday I have a special message from my ground controllers in Cologne for all you Earthlings: "Kölle Alaaf!" #PhilaeThursday It's my birthday! Rosetta and I launched 7 years ago today on our 10-yr journey to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. #Rosetta and I are on course for #comet 67-P  after a successful Deep Space Maneuver. http://bit.ly/dE08ep #PhilaeThursday My engineers & scientists are looking fwd to seeing results of Stardust-NExT flyby - still so much we don't know abt comets! #PhilaeThursday Congrats to the Stardust-NExT team on their flyby of comet Tempel-1! The distance between me and the Earth is actually decreasing at the moment... can anybody guess why? my clever science team are still busy analyzing possible descents for me at the comet. I can safely land at up to 4 km/h #PhilaeThursday update is a little late this week... sorry! Happy Birthday to my Project Manager Stephan Ulamec! #PhilaeThursday Rosetta is performing a series of thruster burns  tweaking our course to the comet. Read more at http://bit.ly/3sqoDO #PhilaeThursday I can't talk to my ground controllers directly - Rosetta passes my messages to Earth with its powerful antenna & vice-versa. #PhilaeThursday The check out is over - I have started my long Hibernation Phase on DOY 342 08-Dec-2010 at 23:47 UTC. zzzzzzzz I landed safely! Well  not really  but the Separation-Descent-Landing test went perfectly. Comet 67/P  here I come! checkout is going well  I've had a new version of my flight software uploaded and am now preparing to rehearse the landing 1st block of tests went well  all experiments working well. My ground engineers are also testing my behaviour at v.low (-45°C) temps - brr! Special #PhilaeThursday here today  I've been switched on for the final checkout of my units and systems before hibernation until 2014 My ground engineers are busy preparing for "PC13" - the last chance to checkout my systems and instruments until 2014! #PhilaeThursday (continued) The change came when my launch was delayed by a year and my planned route to Wirtanen became impossible. #PhilaeThursday Although I am flying towards comet 67/P Churyumov-Gerasimenko  I was originally designed to land on comet 46/P Wirtanen. #PhilaeThursday I am being carried by the Rosetta probe.

Lots of requests for Free Spirit shirts. Anyone can upload a design to CafePress or look for @strangegoat's design there. No need to drool over Free Spirit shirts  unless you're a future rover driver like Ronan.

Thanks to @Nancy_A for this story on Julian  Spirit efforts to get free http://tinyurl.com/73fm3 Although Julian's idea won't work  my drivers love  his enthusiasm & sent him a big thank you & invite to JPL  http://twitpic.com/67ohj Julian's idea to use the arm is a good start. It's not strong enough to push the rover out but perhaps it can be used in other ways. Congrats to @marssciencelab on getting a new name:  Curiosity!  story at http://bit.ly/6V0Gm Opportunity hits the 10-mile mark! After a 50 meter drive on sol 1897 total odometry is 16 133.96 meters or 10.025 miles. W00t! Opportunity continues driving & has surpassed 16 km on its odometer. It's one drive away from passing the 10-mile mark. Spirit's handlers working ways to get her free from a sand trap on Mars.. They'll use a full-scale model at JPL to test manuevers. Opportunity's findings at Victoria crater are published in the journal Science. More info here:  http://bit.ly/i6Au Looking at data returned by Oppy from Victoria crater  scientists report a history of wind and water over billions of years. Oppy's wheel issue is intermittant: occasional spikes in current drawn by a front wheel indicating friction. With TLC  it's working Engineers are examing pics & data. They'll work w/ a twin rover model at JPL to develop an exit strategy. More at: http://tr.im/l5I9 A little help here? Spirit has driven into soft ground  burying her wheels halfway. Engineers are working plans to extricate her. Hope you're all following today's shuttle launch  liftoff at 2:01pm ET  18:01 UTC.  Watch on www.nasa.gov/ntv. Good luck to the crew! Huh!

Details: http://tr.im/iW6t . If you can't go  watch the Ustream Saturday: http://tr.im/jA2g Until 2007  when a massive dust storm hit Spirit and Oppy  they were producing ~700 watt hours. 2007 video: http://tr.im/jCY4 Good Q from @DavidCWG. In 2004  solar arrays produced 900 watt hours per sol. Today Spirit produces 306 watt hours; Oppy 447. Opportunity has the pedal to the metal  traveling almost 1/2 kilometer this week on the way to Endeavour crater. Spirit is better behaved & driving again  headed for a spot  500 feet away. Her power is up 10% after a nice dust-clearing breeze. So many wins for Spirit and Oppy:  Engineering win  science win  and don't forget the #herebeforeoprah win. How many times has your car gone in for service in the past five years?  For Spirit and Opportunity the answer is *zero* Spirit rebooted her computer twice over the weekend for unknown reasons. She's in a healthy state  but reboots are being investigated. Serendipitous science: Spirit's stuck wheel churned up some bright soil on Saturday's drive. Silicates or sulfur?

Good news: next rover @marsscience lab is not solar powered. Lot's of people ask  why no dust wipers on the rovers? Engineers looked into many cleaning options but found more reasons to go without them You can read about the energy boost here: http://is.gd/jqHD  or watch a video report with rover driver Matt Heverly: http://is.gd/jqGU Spirit has a bit more energy!  A nice Martian wind blew away some dust from her solar panels  giving her a boost of 30 watt-hours/day. Sorry. IDD is Instrument Deployment Device  aka "robotic arm." RAT is the Rock Abrasion Tool  a grinding wheel & brush on the arm.

Yes  she found the sun in the sky  but not exactly where expected. Is her orientation off a bit? Sun-finding is important 4 a rover. Better news from Spirit:  She found the sun  just not where she expected.  I'm sure it happens to all of us :)  Diagnosis continues. Spirit is having some behavior issues.  She'll undergo diagnostics to determine the cause.

The televised show is over (right on the button)  but the audience is staying to watch a few award presentations & the DVD Bradbury brought. Miles (@milesobrien): "there are interested people out there-- the mainstream media may no longer be the best way to reach them." Miles: "the world is shifting below the media's feet.  Today's bloggers  tweeters  etc  can compete with an army of journalists. Miles: "what happened to the media? Why do we see more Brittany Spears than Tony Spear? (Tony was the project mgr of Mars Pathfinder). LOL Miles:  "You are big gamblers. You risk a whole career on a 6 minute plunge in the atmosphere. That's ALL IN baby." Miles: "Spirit and Oppy are literally  figuratively "rock stars." If I had their Q rating I'd still be at CNN" Oh yes right! EDGAR Rice Burroughs. Apologies and thanks for correcting me. Keynote speaker @MilesOBrien talks about leaving CNN  the impact of the rovers  and the future of space journalism. Ray talking about the night we landed on the moon. "The night we landed on the moon I wept with joy." He wrote his first work at 12 after reading Edward Rice Burroughs. And he loved Percival Lowell's canals. "I was madly in love with Mars" Ray Bradbury : "The reason I"m here is because I'm the first Martian."  Says he decided to become a writer when he was 12 years old. Ray Bradbury on now  a standing ovation from everyone in the room!! A little garbled  but a congratulations video from Cmmdr. Mike Finke on the International Space Station.   Now  Ray Bradbury. Ray Bradbury entering the auditorium now  while we're in the video tribute to Oppy. What an incredible honor to have him join us for this!

It's the vernal equinox  the first day of Spring in the southern hemisphere of Mars. More sunlight to come = more power! Our eyes (and "feet") on Mars celebrate their 5th anniversary on the Red Planet in January.  Rovers FTW!  Video: http://is.gd/da8A Oppy continues to study cobbles at Santorini before driving again. Rover fan @nivnac put together these great panoramas: http://is.gd/d5TQ Spirit tried to back-up off of 'Home Plate' but with some slippage. She'll probably drive forward & take the long way to the next target. Solar conjunction (and the comm blackout) is over  now both rovers are looking to move to their next science locations. Spirit & Oppy prepping for solar conjunction  when Sun is between Earth & Mars blocking communications for a 2-week period. Begins Nov. 29. Oppy making excellent progress on the trip to Endeavour Crater  having traveled over 1800 meters (1.1 miles). Route map: http://is.gd/99PU Spirit shows her spirit after a dust storm;  Oppy is on an awesome road trip. The latest rover video report is up: http://tinyurl.com/57hmyv That's our girl! Spirit communicated today just as instructed. Battery charge didn't go low enough to trigger fault-protection. Big cheers. During a dust storm  it is the dust kicked up into the atmosphere that is the biggest problem  reducing sunlight reaching solar panels. Questions re: brushes/wipers: They weren't needed for the initial 90-day mission  & periodic wind gusts have done a good job cleaning panels Spirit  hit by a regional dust storm  has reached lowest power levels ever: http://tinyurl.com/3tbma8 Watch the rovers on National Geographic's special  "Five Years on Mars " this Sunday  Nov. 2 at 8pm PT and ET.

Average driving speed for Sprit and Oppy is a cool 5 cm (2 inches) per second  @chriswcollins. The record 1-day drive is 219 meters (721 ft) A 7-mile (12km) drive could take up to two years @park3.  Oppy could go 110 meters per day  stopping to work along the way. Road trip! Oppy is heading out on a long drive  over 7 miles  toward a new destination: massive Endeavor crater. http://tinyurl.com/3vnb76 Spirit is doing small science chores & conserving power while waiting for more sunshine to boost energy (which continues at 245 watt-hours) Oppys rehab on the shoulder joint went well so a new task was assigned: check out & analyze some nearby dust patches. The latest Mars Rover Report video now posted at http://tinyurl.com/rover-report  (this one hosted by @marsroverdriver) Opportunity  fresh from the climb out of Victoria crater  used the nav cam to take this self portrait on Tuesday: http://twitpic.com/adel Good news for Spirit. Solar array energy up slightly from 235 to 245 watt-hours as winter wanes. Skies slightly clearer this week  too. Spirit is riding out end of winter in her south hemisphere locale  mostly sleeping & doing science every few days  until power levels go up.

We've got a great view from the car  staying toasty for now! About to head back to KSC  looking at 60% launch likelihood again. Leaving earlier which may give us a better spot but also means more cold! Working on a playlist for the car during tonight's #STS130 wait. "Rocket Man " "Space Oddity " "Major Tom" are must-haves. More? #spacesongs Headed back toward KSC to nap before tonight's #STS130 attempt. We had to drive 4hrs to/from Tampa to drop off our launch guest. So tired! This automatically moves #SDOisGO back  too. I guess I'll be here at least one day beyond what I expected! No go. :( Perhaps there will be consolation waffles. And some shopping for cold weather gear before tomorrow night! I need some gloves. Weather is improving... still cold for people   but perhaps not too cloudy for rockets! Fingers crossed. Launch and celebratory waffles! This is crazy. I can see the SPACE SHUTTLE. Driving through KSC for #STS130. The Shuttle lights are a beacon in the distance. This is such a dream come true for a big space geek! :D Trying to figure out when the ISS will pass overhead here in FL. In MD  @twisst tells me it's soon after the launch. What about here? On the road to Kennedy! Scoping out the locations of Waffle Houses for post-launch caffeination. We've got snacks and binoculars. #STS-130 Trying to set up PockeTwit for tweets during #SDOisGO  since it handles multiple accounts. But can I just see ONE account's feed at a time? I haven't slept in 32 hours... but I beat the DC-area snow and made it to Florida! Prepare for plenty of tweets about STS-130 and #SDOisGo! Do I really have to leave for the airport in 2.5 hours for #SDOisGO? Should I even bother sleeping? I think I've got a longer way - from MD through TX! RT @lyonsdigital: Heading to #KSC #NASAtweetup for #SDOisGo the long way  through Miami. If you're flying to (or from) the DC area for #SDOisGO festivities  most airlines are rebooking people & waiving fees for affected flights. Rescheduled my flights for STS-130 and #SDOisGO for 5AM Friday (ouch). Looks like I'll barely escape the snow that's coming to the DC area! Recognize anyone in the list of correspondents? :D RT @NASA_SDO: Who's Tweeting from KSC at #SDOisGO #NASATweetup? http://ow.ly/d/1y1 (pdf) Big DC-area snowstorm 2/5-6 doesn't look good for STS-130 travel plans. I'm scrambling to figure out my options and make alternate plans. I've finally scored a hotel room near KSC for the STS-130 launch before #SDOisGO. Been trying for ages. All it took was being up at 3AM! ;) This week  we're nailing down some upcoming episodes and getting ready for our presence at the #SDOisGO festivities - both at GSFC and KSC! P.S. We've got some photos from the meeting on our website  if you want the visual AND auditory experience! Enjoy! Things are all coming together for our participation in #SDOisGO festivities! Found a hotel near KSC with rooms - harder than you'd think! http://twitpic.com/1080gz - We actually shared six posters about our education/outreach projects - I couldn't quite fit them all into one ph http://twitpic.com/107xhn - Had a poster party at Goddard today and shared our Blueshift poster from the AAS meeting this month! http://twitpic.com/106bci - This is my desk. I really do love geeky toys! Offices here sometimes look like the @ThinkGeek catalog. I'm a little jealous that @ThinkGeek is providing goodies for the #SDOisGO #nasatweetup here at Goddard while I'm in FL. I &lt;3 geeky toys! We're honored to see some Shorty Award nominations in #science - we've got good company in the category! http://bit.ly/shorty Trying to nail down plans for #SDOisGO participation during launch down at Kennedy. Planning a trip around a date that could change is hard! We're excited to hear that @RapidEye received his package of goodies from one of our AAS contests! Enjoy - and everyone else  keep watching! http://twitpic.com/z2pps - Things have been busy around here - just picked this up today! It's really happening!

Attempting to edit the latest podcast with construction on three sides of my office. Power tool noises make audio editing... interesting. I love wearing science-y tshirts! Wearing my LHC shirt (http://bit.ly/887Qes) today. Show me your favorite science shirts! #tshirtthursday Saw "BLAST!" (http://bit.ly/5EN2Oz) last night  and it hit really close to home for me. All about the trials and tribulations of ballooning! I don't think 5056 steps was too shabby for a day in the poster and exhibit hall. At my stride that's over 2 miles. Conferences = hard work! http://twitpic.com/x035a - Final count: 5056 steps! Everyone was over  but @temec was closest. Msg me for your prize! One hour left to tweet your pedometer predictions! I've spent a couple of hours sitting in a movie screening (about scientific balloons). Contest open until 9PM EST: Guess how many steps I walked at AAS and win a pedometer! Closest estimate wins  and I've been walking a lot! http://twitpic.com/wyiof - I think I found the bin that maimed @BadAstronomer. Ouch. I didn't stick my hand in. Last AAS contest! I got a LSST pedometer at their booth. Closest guess by 9PM EST of how many steps I take today wins their own pedometer! http://twitpic.com/wy58d - Name that satellite and win a grab bag of stickers  posters  and more! And @priesett not only figured out that was a model of the plane for  @SOFIAtelescope  he also spelled out the acronym. Msg for your prize! Congrats @joedaviso (msg me) for identifying the CCD array from the X-ray Grating Spectrometer on IXO! More on the XGS: http://bit.ly/56uqdJ http://twitpic.com/wxony - We'll go for a harder one.

This is communications central during big events. Bonus - about to tour the Space Operations Center here at NASA HQ. That's it! Wrapping up with another listen to "Star Girl" by McFly. Thanks for following us during the #nasatweetup! Q: Are there any pranks on the ISS? Perhaps people floated around during sleep? A: Would be a good prank  hasn't happened yet. #nasatweetup Wrapping up with questions to Astronaut Mike Fincke  who's not floating around. Four astronauts in three places in one day! #nasatweetup Well  here goes "Star Girl" - it's playing live for the ISS crew on-orbit. And we ended contact with the ISS. #nasatweetup ISS crew "swimming" over to investigate a cautionary alarm that just went off in the station. Much more important than the #nasatweetup. BTW  you can follow @TomJones_Astro  our guest astronaut locally here at NASA HQ. #nasatweetup Momentary delay while ISS crew signal switches TDRSS satellite - takes 20 seconds to sync with next satellite. A break! #nasatweetup "What we're doing up here is opening up new opportunities." ~ Nicole Stott during #nasatweetup RT @AeroLeaders2: Noticed that belts not fashionable on the ISS.

We're really talking about space stuff here  folks! Question from @JourneyIndustry about astronaut dreams answered - Tom Jones dreamt about making mistakes during the flight. Micro-g dreams! They've brought out the "space snuggie" - flight sleeping bags! Float into the bag  tuck in  zip up  clip yourself to the wall! #nasatweetup Q: What do astronauts do on their days off? A: "Drink in the view." They've also got books  movie nights  and even a guitar! #nasatweetup If you're tuning into NASA TV  Astronaut Tom Jones (not the *singer* Tom Jones) will be speaking at the #nasatweetup about his 4 flights. Teenage girls pressure NASA to play "Star Girl" for the ISS. It's happening at 11:49AM. "Whoa  your gravity's making me dizzy!" #nasatweetup We're being prepared for NASA TV and the ISS uplink. There's a 4-second delay between us and ISS. Not supposed to say  "Can you hear me??" We're live from the #nasatweetup! Featuring slightly disconcerting headless astronaut suit. http://yfrog.com/5mhu7j (photo from @bethbeck) Q: After the Shuttle retires  how will ISS get cargo? A: Looking for options for other carriers  data transfer  Soyuz... #nasatweetup Did you know... U2 has been showing ISS footage at their concerts? Bono is a huge fan and has been talking with ISS! #nasatweetup Apparently the engineers down in Houston suggested naming the C.O.L.B.E.R.T. treadmill - and that publicity got people into the contest!

Valentine's Day: love or hate it-Greek constellations tell some tragic love stories. Did you know many of these stars have orbiting planets? Got a cool interview w/ Geoff Marcy (Kepler) coming up in a couple days - get ready to get even more stoked about the mission! RT @nasaspaceplace Is there life on planets around other stars? Read a story in rhyme about a girl on a planet hunt. http://bit.ly/bgzxS. Also - WASP-18 b  which has the distinction of being the first dying planet found - it's got 1 mil. yrs. before SMACK - right into its star. Meanwhile  CoRoT has discovered the first confirmed terrestrial exoplanet! It's one of two super-Earth size planets that orbit the star. Ok  I'm back  and the planet news has piled up! For starters  cross WASP-9 off the exoplanet list - looks like it's actually a binary star. In this case "b" is a roasting hot Jupiter with a 3-day orbit  and "c" is a portly 15xJupiter-mass planet with a super-eccentric orbit. HAT-13-b and c have people pretty excited-it's the first time a multi-planet system with one transiting planet has been discovered! Another new one  HD 110014b  is a little bit smaller @ 11 Jup masses  and has a pretty eccentric  egg-shaped orbit around its star. Anybody checked out Greg Laughlin's blog at oklo.org? It's dope...well-written  cool photos  and lots of stuff to ponder.... Also had some folks announce that they'd observed the phases of an exoplanet as it orbited in front of and then behind its host star...whoa! PlanetQuest isn't dead! We've had a few new planet additions  and some interesting finds...like an exoplanet in Andromeda...maybe??? Props to everyone who came to the JPL Open House! Esp. the RoboDome line survivors...a little video from inside the dome:  http://is.gd/xhrz Fun fact  HAT-P-12 b's transit was also detected by an amateur astronomer in Portugal...lots of people getting in on the planet hunt! New planet! HAT-P-12 b is a sub-Saturn size planet orbiting in a scorching 3.2 day orbit... If you're in SoCal this weekend  come check out the (free) JPL open house! See cool stuff  talk to scientists  visit the legendary ROBODOME! That's not all! HD 96167 b is a gas giant planet with an eccentric orbit that takes it as close as Mercury to our sun and farther than Mars. Reply @ZorkFox The "waterworld" theory is based on its orbit and models that predict lots of ice/water on its surface-just a guess for now. So  to sum up  Gliese 581 d = Kamino (maybe)  Gliese 581 e = Mustafar (maybe). Confused? A handy reference: http://is.gd/tJOi This just in...Gliese 581 e is just 1.9x the size of the Earth and is the smallest exoplanet yet discovered! It could possibly terrestrial. Kepler will start collecting scientific data in a few weeks - so far  so good. The Kepler dust cover was ejected successfully! Scientists now know what kind of background noise to subtract from the science data. OK  scratch that last post...the dust cover will be ejected in about an hour at the *earliest*...sorry for the confusion! Kepler's dust cover is scheduled to be ejected in about an hour at the latest...w Get stoked for 100 hours of Astronomy!  Some cool stuff...like Kepler and Spitzer webcasts or the chance get to control a remote telescope! The other new planet is also in constellation Draco...HD 139357 b is a hefty 9.8x Jupiter-size gas giant  with an 1125-day orbit. Well  it's been pretty quiet lately  but finally we have some new planets! 42 Dra b is a gas giant orbiting a sun-size star at about 1.2 AU. Kepler has launched! Right on!!!!  Everything seems to be going well so far  nearly 15 minutes into the flight. This planet was teased out of previously existing radial velocity data for HD 11506 using Bayesian analysis. Gas giant! HD 11506 c is a little smaller than Jupiter  with a pretty eccentric orbit that averages about .64 AU from its host star. Planet Alert! Not much info on CoRoT-Exo-6 b yet  but it appears to be a Hot-Jupiter type with a very close 8-day orbit around its star. Interestingly  they have a 3:2 mean motion resonance  meaning that over the same amount of time  one planet makes 3 orbits  the other 2. Couple new planets announced today...HD 45364 b and c are gas giants that orbit at about .7 and. .9 AU  respectively  eccentric orbits too. Despite what you may have read  the new planet is NOT confirmed to be the smallest in mass discovered - it's about 11x times Earth's mass. New Super-Earth discovered!  HD 7924 b is about 10x the size of Earth  but with a tiny  5-day orbit around its star. Bring the sunblock. Questions about exoplanets? Bring 'em on! Scientists estimate the size of MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb to be about 3.3 Earth masses - still pretty small  but not quite as much as was reported. Heads up - the 1.5 Earth-size planet reported yesterday was a false alarm-some confusion between a couple of reports. Kepler's going to watch the sky for a few years  looking for transiting exoplanets and letting us know just how many Earths might be nearby. Just 49 days until the launch of the Kepler mission...get excited!  We've got a countdown and mission info at planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov And the planet train keeps on rolling...HD 173416 b is about 2.7x Jup. size and has a year almost as long as ours  at 323 days. HD 181433 d  on the other hand  is just over half Jupiter's mass and takes just about 6 Earth years to make its orbit...we're up to 333 now! New planets for the weekend...HD 183263 c is about 4 Jup mass and take about 8 Earth years to orbit its star. OGLE2-TR-L9 is an even bigger  closer roaster - 4.5x Jup size (!) with an even tighter 2.5 day orbit - it's no place to spend the holidays. New planets!  HAT-P-8 b is a hot-Jupiter type planet that's about 1.5x Jup. size and has a quick 3-day orbit time...another roaster! Its sister planet HD 191760 c is a bit bigger (7.2x Jup. size) and orbits farther away (.42 AU)  albeit with a pretty eccentric orbit. And the planet train doesn't stop...HD 191760 b is about 1/3 the size of Jup. and snuggles right up to its host star with an 8.5 day orbit! So we're up to 326 planets discovered  but more importantly  we finally have visible-light images of 4 exoplanets...Christmas comes early! And finally  HR 8799 d orbits at 24 AU and sits about 24 AU from its star.  Both HD 8799 and Fomalhaut are visible from Earth (stars only). HR 8799 c is another big ol' gas giant  10x Jup size  orbiting its star at a distance of 38 AU.  That makes for a 69 000 day-long year! One of the trio of planets that was imaged  HR 8799 b  is about 7x Jupiter size and orbits a hefty 68 AU from its host  also a blue star. One of the imaged planets  Fomalhaut b  is no bigger than 3x Jupiter size.  It orbits about 115AU from its host  a young blue star. Here's another link with a better picture of the three planets discovered from the ground: http://is.gd/7nq3 And it doesn't stop there!  Scientists also managed to snap pics of 3 more from the GROUND...wow! Check it out... http://is.gd/7niB BIG exoplanet news coming up later today!  Stay tuned! So now we're up to 322 planets!  These latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky  using the radial velocity method. Now  this is a big one.  HD 43848 b is 25x Jupiter size and has a really odd  eccentric orbit. Planet or brown dwarf? It's not clear yet. HD 143361 b is a 3 Jupiter-mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was Earth orbits from our Sun. Correction to the last post - planet's name is HD 48265 b.  Yet another poetic exoplanet moniker. Halloween planets!  HD 48265 is a gas giant  about the size of Jupiter with an orbit about as far out from its star as Mars' is. That makes 6 new planets discovered and brings our planet count to 319! Get the fine details on these cool new worlds at http://is.gd/2FWR. HD 20868 b is gas giant with a super eccentric orbit - if it orbited our sun it would swing from closer than Mercury to farther than Mars! HD 131664 is a massive planet 18x the size of Jupiter.  It has a very eccentric orbit that takes it 1951 days to complete. HD 73267 is 3x the size of Jupiter  with an orbit of 1260 days around a star just hotter than our sun - about 2x as long as Mars' year. BD-17 63 b is a big ol' 5x Jupiter size-planet with a pretty eccentric  655-day orbit around its small star. Lots of new planets to announce!  HD 145377 b is almost 6x the size of Jupiter and orbits about half an AU from a sunlike star. Lupus-TR-3 b is back on the list-new evidence shows it's a planet.  This is a Jupiter-size world that's only .04 AU from its star...Hot! Looks like Lupus-TR-3 b might actually be part of a multiple star and not actually a planet  so we're dropping it from the count for now. Weird...COROT-exo-3b is the size of Jupiter but 20x its mass!  Scientists aren't yet sure just what it actually is! Link: http://is.gd/3GuU Looks like the HAT and WASP teams found the same planet at the same time!  So now it's called HAT-P-10/WASP-11 and the count is back to 313. This actually just refers to extrasolar planets not in our own solar system  good question! For those keeping score  this brings us up to 313 planets discovered and 32 multi-planet solar systems so far...it's a busy neighborhood! And HD 60532 c is more than 2x the size of Jupiter and orbits its star about as far away as Mars is from our sun. Looks like today's a triple play for new planets!  HD 60532 b is just about the size of Jupiter and orbits at abou .759 AU from its star. New planet added today: CT Cha b crams 17 Jup-masses into a planet just 2.2 times as big and orbiting @ 440 AU - possibly a brown dwarf? MOA-2007-BLG-400-L was discovered using gravitational lensing  an exotic way to hunt for planets using light bent by the gravity from stars. New planet for Talk Like A Pirate Day! Not much info yet about MOA-2007-BLG-400-L -it's about the size of Jupiter and .85 AU from its star. It's been a busy week for planet-hunters: 3 new gas giants announced and one retracted for a total count of 309 exoplanets discovered. NASA has announced the Carl Sagan Fellowships in Exoplanet Exploration!  The stipend will be $60 000 a year to selected postdocs. Remember  to see the stats for any of these planets  just visit http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/atlas and type in the name of the planet. TW Hydrae b has been dropped from the atlas due to findings that it might have been a detection of stellar spots instead. And one more: HD 154672  which is about 5x the size of Jupiter  .6 AU from its star  which is just about Sun-size.  Big planet! HD 205739 was also announced: it's 1.37 times the size of Jupiter  and orbits about .9 AU from its star  which is 1.22x the size of the sun. At long last  we have some new planet updates!   GJ 832 b is about half the size of Jupiter and orbits 3.4 AU from its tiny host star. New story on planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov - "Backyard planet hunting: Amateur astronomers join the exoplanet race" New BIG planet! 14 And b is 248 light years away  4.8 times the mass of Jupiter and has a 186-day orbit.

Info at planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/atlas The number of exoplanets discovered has passed the 300 mark with the latest announcements - currently it's at 303! Just an FYI - the PlanetQuest site is planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov. 3 New Super-Earths discovered  plus evidence that there are many more!  Details on PlanetQuest. Another new exoplanet around HD 102272 posted - 2.6 times Jupiter mass  1.57 AU from the star  520-day period! New exoplanet posted today - 5.9 times the mass of Jupiter  with a 128-day orbital period  orbiting .62 AU from the star HD 102272. New exoplanet posted today - 2.6 times the mass of Jupiter  with a 128-day orbital period  orbiting .62 AU from the star HD 102272. June 3 - Scientists have discovered the smallest planet yet.

Have a great flight @AstroKarenN @astro_luca ! Spare Space capsule?This just showed up beside my parking lot at JSC.Must be a test capsule from Gemini days. http://t.co/DVtkSE8cB7 A hallway of photos in our office building welcomes expedition members Kevin  @Cmdr_Hadfield &amp; @AstroMarshburn back! http://t.co/KjmWsLYBf7 More surreal than I had imagined  seeing @Cmdr_Hadfield walk down the plane steps after just seeing him in space yesterday.Made an impact. We've got @Cmdr_Hadfield @AstroMarshburn back at the Johnson Space Center.Into lab rat mode now  need to pull the medical science. Can you believe @Cmdr_Hadfield @AstroMarshburn trip home is still going?Kazakhstan-Houston would have taken 45min yesterday today...24hrs! Many asked why they washed crews hands after Soyuz egress. Looked like black residue from hatch produced by re-entry plasma burning capsule I completed phone interviews in England  Scotland  Hungary. Next one is in New Zealand. Wow  @Cmdr_Hadfield  you really touched the world! Tonight is medical checks for crew  shower and then @AstroMarshburn @Cmdr_Hadfield will be flown to Houston by Tues night.Journey continues. Congratulations Canadian Space Agency! Your support for @Cmdr_Hadfield enabled an amazing mission! @csa_asc An amazing thing just took place. Three humans just left orbit at 28000km/h and are now sitting safely on the planet! Awesome to see the entire crew out of the capsule now! Welcome back to earth @AstroMarshburn @Cmdr_Hadfield! You've done us proud! Touchdown. We are celebrating! http://t.co/WDCQsbcgg0 Crew doesn't know exactly when touchdown will occur. Must brace themselves early  close their jaws and wait for the impact. About 1 min till touchdown. Don't be fooled by the term 'soft landing thrusters'. They are basically explosives that fire at 1m to slow the Soyuz. Roman is calling condition of spacecraft over radio. Mentioned the seats shock absorbers have extended  ready to absorb extreme ldg shock. This is the best part! Seeing a good parachute and hearing the crew over the radio. Good chute! I've heard flown astronauts describe the parachute opening sequence as 'there is no way this is nominal'. Must be some ride. Parachute about to open. Then it really starts rock'n &amp; roll'n. Soyuz has a backup chute just in case. Deceleration will start slow but build to approx 4x force of gravity for nominal entry.Like 4 people sitting on your chest.Tough to breath . @AstroMarshburn @Cmdr_Hadfield 's last landing was a gentle one compared to what they are about to experience! Enjoy the ride! We lose communication with the capsule during re-entry. This is normal. Capsule is about to interface with the atmosphere.Cue the fireworks! Soyuz capsule over Africa now  on final approach for Kazakhstan.Crew busy now watching closely to make sure entry attitude is just right Our view of landing where friends&amp;family are gathered at mission control. Serious but confident/excited atmosphere. http://t.co/EfCRDOKZB2 Now Soyuz splits in 3 pieces.Middle part has our precious cargo.Other 2 pieces burn up trash section&amp; engine/computer/power section. Final backup mode is ballistic.Capsule rolls constantly  capsule will land safe but way off Tgt and over 9X force of gravity. Sporty! The manual entry mode is hand flown by Cmdr. Rolling the capsule left and right with offset centre of gravity  can ctrl G forces &amp; accuracy Accurate de-orbit burn!  Great news! This de-orbit burn slows the capsule by 450km/h. After that the remaining 27500km/h is taken care of by atmospheric drag and the parachute. Soyuz de-orbit burn is underway. No turning back now  they're coming back to earth now! At least somewhere on the planet. If Soyuz automated entry system fails  then it gets more interesting for crew. Crew will manually fly the capsule or enter in ballistic mode Want to watch the landing live? Tune in here starting at 9:30pmEDT. @csa_asc @Astro_DavidS will host. http://t.co/5VCkE3VKMQ Big unknown in Soyuz landing accuracy is not orbital mechanics  it is the wind during the parachute ride(15min). @csa_asc @Cmdr_Hadfield Now crew waits for de-orbit burn at 9:37pmET. Till then monitor systems  ensure suits ready and strap in tight. Real tight! I'm watching Soyuz departure. Crew is seeing a view of their #ISS home as they depart. Roman's comment "Unreal". Soyuz 33S is on its way with @Cmdr_Hadfield @AstroMarshburn. @csa_asc http://t.co/XmpQduA3On Soyuz capsule waited 5 months as a rescue ship if @Cmdr_Hadfield needed.Now it will bring crew fm 28000km/hr to 0.G Forces &amp; Fireworks! Tonight 9:00-9:30CT @AstroMarshburn @Cmdr_Hadfield &amp;Roman will have the ride of their lives.Soyuz re-entry is violent  jaw-jarring but safe. Look close noticed while working Capcom @Cmdr_Hadfield is showing hockey team loyalty on his final day in space. http://t.co/bXu35iErOQ #thankyoucommanderhadfield.Your tremendous efforts &amp; perspective have reminded us to appreciate our planet and its people!

More Apollo 11 random space facts as the day progresses 13 people have been in space at once before  but today is 1st time there have been 13 at the ISS  after Endeavour's docking. Today is the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch. Apollo 11 astronauts left the lunar surface only 21.5 hours after landing.  Later Apollo missions spent more time. Space Shuttle successfully in orbit.  Orbital speed for Earth: about 17 500 miles per hour. Shuttle launch scrubbed due to weather.  To be launched tomorrow or Wednesday. During a shuttle launch  main (orbiter) engines light at T-6.6 sec. Shuttle held down by bolts. Solid rocket boosters light at T-0. Weather currently no go for shuttle 18:51 EDT launch  but still hoping. Since the Miss Universe pageant was in Australia a few days after Skylab de-orbited  pieces were displayed on stage. The space station Skylab re-entered the atmosphere 30 years ago today.  Pieces splattered across Indian Ocean and Western Australia. Clarification of last tweet: shuttle launch scheduled tomorrow for 7:39 p.m.  EDT  i.e.  19:39 EDT. Shuttle Endeavor scheduled launch tomorrow at 7:39 EDT. 16-day mission. 5 spacewalks to install Kibo Japanese Experiment Module parts. The altitude of geostationary satellites is about 100 times higher than the altitude of the International Space Station. Both Pluto and its moon Charon are tidally locked with each other  i.e.  the same face of Pluto is always facing the same face of Charon. In rough numbers  Mars is about 1/2 the diameter of Earth  but has only about 1/10 the mass. Tho many orbiters have impacted Moon  (2 this year Chinese Chang'E & Japanese Kaguya)  LCROSS' primary mission is the impact & observing it. NASA LCROSS  did successful lunar swingby Tues.  setting it up for October 9 lunar impact to search for water ice in polar shadowed crater. NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) went into lunar orbit yesterday. It will return more data from the Moon than any previous mission. NASA's LRO and LCROSS  launched Thursday  get close to Moon tomorrow (Tues.).   The first lunar orbiter was Soviet Luna 10 in 1966. RT @NASA "For tanking [the Shuttle] lightning cannot be within 5 mi. of the launch pad. "  Result: If no fuel now  no launch Wed.  a.m. Pele  largest volcano on Jupiter's moon Io  throws sulfur materials to heights 30 times that of Mt. Everest over an area the size of France. Because they are closer to the Sun  Mercury and Venus are never visible from Earth during middle of the night only early evening or pre-dawn Vanguard 1  launched March 17  1958  is still in Earth orbit  making it the oldest human-made object in space. Luna 3 was the first spacecraft to take pictures of the far side of the Moon.  Its orbit led it to eventually burn up in Earth's atmosphere. Almost all of the lunar Maria (dark areas visible to your eye which were formed by basaltic lavas) are on the near side of the Moon. Starting tomorrow with docking at 5:36 a.m. PDT of Soyuz TMA-15 to ISS  the Int'l space station will have 6 person crews instead of 3. 5 missions are active at Mars: NASA's Mars Odyssey  Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter  2 Mars rovers Spirit & Opportunity  and ESA's Mars Express. There are images taken on the surface of Venus from just four landing sites: the USSR's Venera 9  10  13  14. Shuttle landing scheduled for Saturday.  When a shuttle lands  time from wheels touching down to wheels stopped is about one minute. Pre-dawn: Jupiter bright in Southeast  Venus  brighter below & to left in East  dimmer Mars below Venus.  On Thurs  crescent Moon near Venus Info about  most distant event ever observed: Gamma Ray Burst &gt; 13 billion light years away on Planetary Radio this wk http://bit.ly/R9iCX Hubble repair astronaut Grunsfeld's lifetime spacewalk time: 58hrs 30min--4th all time behind Ross  Lopez-Alegria  and #1 Solovyev's 82h22m. Hubble Space Telescope's mirrors are so smooth that their surfaces do not deviate from a perfect curve by more than 1/800 000ths of an inch. Today's STS-125 spacewalk at 7 hrs 56 min was 8th longest ever  and was 1 hr less than the longest that occurred in 2001 on STS-102 at ISS. ESA’s far IR telescope Herschel & cosmic background mapper Planck launched today. Herschel is largest launched telescope: it has 3.5m mirror Hubble Space Telescope (HST) just successfully grappled by Atlantis space shuttle.  HST mass is over 11 000 kg. NASA's Kepler has started science operations hunting exoplanets. Interview with lead scientist on Planetary Radio http://planetary.org/radio Shuttle Atlantis doing great.  Solid rocket boosters separated: each weigh 1 300 000 pounds at launch; land in the ocean 141 mi. downrange. Space shuttle Atlantis STS-125 has launched on way to service the Hubble Space Telescope. Shuttle still scheduled to launch at 14:01 EDT.  This will be the 126th space shuttle launch  and 30th mission for the Atlantis orbiter. Atlantis' mission to the Hubble Space Telescope will be the sixth to Hubble  counting the mission that first deployed it. STS-125 mission with space shuttle Atlantis scheduled to launch for Hubble Space Telescope repair mission tomorrow (Mon.) at 2:01 EDT. STS-3  the 3rd space shuttle mission  was the first launch with an unpainted external tank and the only landing at White Sands  New Mexico. The diameter of the star Betelgeuse in Orion is as big as the size of at least Mars' orbit  and probably the size of Jupiter’s orbit. The Eta Aquarid meteor shower occurs when the Earth passes through debris left by Halley's comet. Eta Aquarid meteor shower peaks tomorrow morning (Wed.)  20-40 meteors/hr from dark site  especially after Moon sets around 4 a.m. Pre-dawn sky: Jupiter bright star-like object in southeast  Venus even brighter to its lower left in east  and much dimmer Mars below Venus. Apophis: a 270m asteroid that in 2029 will fly closer to Earth than geostationary satellites.  Has &lt; 1 in 45 000 chance to hit Earth in 2036 Near Earth asteroids' surface gravity is tens to hundreds of thousands of times lower than Earth’s. Spacecraft missions more dock than land. About 6000 Near Earth Objects have been discovered; about 800 are bigger than 1 km; about 20% are classed as Potentially Hazardous Objects. I'm in Granada  Spain for the Planetary Defense Conference  presenting and hearing random space facts about the near Earth asteroid threat. After sunset on April 26  look low in the west for Mercury looking like a bright star below the crescent Moon and the Pleides constellation. Jupiter is more massive than all of the other planets in the solar system combined  plus their satellites  the asteroids  and the comets. To learn more about Venus occulting the Moon tomorrow morning  the Lyrids meteors  and planet visibility see: http://tinyurl.com/c2pjkl From western N. America tomorrow (22nd)  the Moon will pass in front of (occult) Venus. Disappears just after 5 a.m. PDT  reappears ~6 a.m. Lyrids meteor shower peaks April 21/22.  Traditionally mediocre shower  but occurrence during New Moon dark skies this year will help out. Pre-dawn sky: Jupiter bright in southeast  even brighter Venus below to left  and dimmer red Mars near Venus. Cresent Moon nearby this week. Carbon dioxide ice  aka dry ice  freezes out of the atmosphere in the winter at Mars’ poles  forming the bulk of its seasonal polar caps. First images in from NASA's Kepler mission. "Just a lot of stars" but when stared at for months and years  Kepler will discover exoplanets! It takes light  including radio communications  over 15 hours one-way to reach Voyager 1  the farthest spacecraft from Earth. Best evening view Mercury this year for next 3 weeks: bright starlike object very low in West after sunset. Gets higher over next few days. Listen to weekly random space facts and join a trivia contest with Bruce Betts and Mat Kaplan on Planetary Radio http://planetary.org/radio The sun is about 440 000 times brighter than the full moon and the full moon is more than 30 000 times brighter than the brightest star. This day in 1961  Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space.  This day in 1981  Columbia became the first space shuttle in space. 50 years ago today  NASA announced its first astronauts: the "Mercury Seven." The youngest rocks on the Moon are older than almost all of the oldest rocks on Earth. A Soyuz spacecraft is scheduled to undock from the Int'l Space Station tonight and bring 3 people to Earth.  3 others remain on the ISS. Valeri Polyakov holds the record for the longest duration single spaceflight: 438 days in 1994-95  most of it on space station Mir. This evening  high in the southeast  the Moon is a few degrees below Saturn.  Saturn is fairly bright  yellowish  and below Leo. The Earth-Moon system (about 384 000 km) would easily fit within the diameter of the Sun (about 1.4 million km). Pre-dawn sky in the East from highest to lowest: Jupiter really bright  Mars less so and reddish  and Venus very low extremely bright. Check out Saturn in the evening sky high in the east: yellowish  fairly bright near Leo. The surface area of Mars is approximately equal to the surface area of the land surfaces (no oceans) on Earth.  Lots to explore! This is my first experimental tweet.  I plan to start some more regular updates in the future  but for now  this is a learning experience.

The startling thing to me is how similar asteroid and Kuiper Belt size distributions seem to be for small sizes. https://t.co/zJ7K4JTyhO My #DPS15 presser slides.

Still need to find an appropriate Big Red Button. Pluto spins on its side and has an elongated orbit. What are its seasons like? MIT PhD student Alissa Earle explains https://t.co/3a1HvqXaMJ Maneuvering to target KBO is larger than any single maneuver New Horizons has attempted. To make as safe as possible  doing multiple burns. No one has ever maneuvered a spaceship so far from home  and we've never targeted a world so distant.   GO  YOU TINY ROCKETS  GO! I feel the need ... the need for speed!  Specifically  about 60 m/s  delivered via hydrazine thrusters to a space robot ON ITS WAY TO A KBO. Pluto in 3D! Go get your red-blue glasses.

I may not have a hoverboard  but I do have sweet sweet Pluto data. I must go out to the edge of things  to the lonely edge of the sky  And all I ask is a small ship and a world to fly it by; Never in history has a spacecraft lit its engines to target a world in the classical Kuiper Belt.

[reluctantly] "Alright  let's do the sanity checks." #thingsactualscientistssay I've been pretty caught up in Pluto lately  but Earth is alright too. http://t.co/1Dw1wxBEiz Non-Pluto paper: submitted. "The haze particles are very small." http://t.co/47HRHjVfOE Ices flowing around the periphery of Tombaugh Regio  swirling around obstacles and into the landscape.  https://t.co/i1W9iW1Lqu The full halo image is lower resolution  but lossless. Some of us stayed up to wait for the late-night downlink... http://t.co/mWyGQRibXu When this image came down  many of us dropped what we were doing and just stared... http://t.co/bYg2Fxb7qD Pluto's farewell to New Horizons. Brilliant hazes softly backlit by the Sun. http://t.co/of1A3fX0er http://t.co/pRfJc14gaO Fun fact: the enhanced-color took a few minutes to process and render  while the natural color took over 12 hours to process and render. Why we send machines: most detailed (yet) global mosaic of Pluto in true and enhanced color. https://t.co/djVZ32bXZg http://t.co/nkoPWnip3n Also  if you liked the enhanced-color image... you should really watch the New Horizons briefing today and prepare to have your mind blown. A world of exotic ice landscapes painted in pastel: our enhanced-color image of Pluto. http://t.co/tIPo0Rmmm9 http://t.co/N4exU6Df6Y What even... http://t.co/s8W0vsFGEa Crunching data from one space robot.

This series has jumped the shark. Soyuz on approach to the ISS. #Sharknado3 http://t.co/Uo35sXQTJw These ads don't seem to be tailored to #Sharknado3 audience. Yes  the test paper is not dissolving on that soap. BUT WOULD IT STOP A SHARK. "But that's not even physics." Actual scientists  re #Sharknado3 Sounds like Ceres is fuming about Pluto and Charon. Pluto?  Pluto. Pluto's dark mountains soaring over bright plains of twisted ice. http://t.co/XebPBltsfn http://t.co/oVElput9e3 Close-up views of Pluto's smaller moons!

"BEEEEEEES." Heading back to Pluto Central  a woman stopped me in the street: "is this the way to the Pluto ... palooza?" :D Tiny child with tiny voice summarizes the mood here: "PWUUUUTOOOOOOO!!!!"

It could help you explore a new planet one day. Some interesting questions and answers about the carbon monoxide spot on Pluto in this thread! #PlutoFlyby https://t.co/ILskIxLuTx If you have Qs about the carbon monoxide on Pluto  I'd suggest you ping @AstroCook - he spotted it in the data! http://t.co/ELyUy1IOru Streaks are frustratingly similar in size to the JPG compression boxes; we have to wait for lossless data to confirm. http://t.co/boCjRAFdkj Look at the earlier false-color map of Pluto. See how the left half appears a different color than the right? http://t.co/sINf4YRTd0 It's great seeing all your reactions to today's releases. We've been puzzling over all these findings and it has been SO exciting. Caption contest! Brian May  Alan Stern  and Cody the GGI Team Penguin! #PlutoFlyby http://t.co/wibrYtVhwo Life  uh  finds a way. http://t.co/F9oFKSTO3s Met Brian May this morning. @CarlyHowett and I then asked if we could take a photo with him and a stuffed penguin. Just gave my first IRL interview since the start of the Pluto encounter. Glad I caught up on sleep a bit last night! "PHOTOMETRISTS TO ACTION STATIONS!" #ThingsActualScientistsSay The New Horizons team got new bumper stickers. I guess I should buy a car. http://t.co/8Zw4mJVirQ Funny story about that @SciShow interview: I was a teeny bit sleep deprived  and I'm very used to seeing Hank Green talking on a computer... Pluto and Charon on the edge of everything. #PlutoFlyby http://t.co/6j9BHFNi6F THIS IS AMAZING. "My Charon-a" inspired by @LauraKeeney! https://t.co/EnrXa3vzkR On the eve of #PlutoFlyby I talked with @hankgreen at @SciShow about our mission to explore the worlds at the edge. https://t.co/a19UnynSSJ There was nine hours between this new data coming down from the spacecraft and the press conference. Sciencing as fast as we can. This vast mountain range lies within the borders of Tombaugh Regio  the heart of Pluto. http://t.co/X8tG41UyG0 The small moon Hydra  a cashew made of ice the size of a Hawaiian island. http://t.co/ELJrkLv6Dv A mountain range on Pluto  rising kilometers up out of a bedrock of water ice. http://t.co/qreaGOpgM7 Here's that full-resolution image of Charon  all ice  ash  and pastels. http://t.co/ENXroppIme It is hard to focus on pressing work when images like that mountain range on Pluto show up on our data servers. Pluto's heart is now being called Tombaugh Regio.  So very fitting. Mountains  Gandalf! I hope you all are catching this. Charon's canyons are VAST. I spent all morning working on getting that Charon image colorized. Hard to get subtle colors right! Are you ready for Charon? You know why I'm excited about that picture of Hydra? It's similar in size and brightness to a typical Kuiper Belt Object. At the NASA New Horizons press event. You should all be watching on NASA TV! http://t.co/WhOXSBXceb Why is everyone (particularly Alan Stern) so excited in those #PlutoFlyby team pictures from this morning? One idea: http://t.co/tAzDuGjlDG What a day. https://t.co/T66bFXOScW So. Who wants to fly by a classical Kuiper Belt Object? New Horizons AI made it through the system without an upset. The instruments collected and recorded the expected amount of information. So many nominals. New Horizons made it through the #PlutoFlyby and is communicating with Earth. WE ARE IN LOCK This is it. I made a graphic of the solar system  which @davidblaine turned into a puzzle and subsequently solved with magic. http://t.co/7R8fIXxwSV Best typo I've seen today: "color-enchanted images" to describe our enhanced-color images of Pluto and Charon. http://t.co/9uxXPtCzZH Upper right: "Bugs."  What kind of bugs?  ... BEEEEEEEEES.  http://t.co/cW2nYRCp7h http://t.co/qu00FZJe9O Enhanced-color images of Pluto &amp; Charon our team made to highlight compositional diversity. http://t.co/tdQAUWBaRN http://t.co/WT3sVg9XxF Less than 12 hours ago @CarlyHowett @AscendingNode @TodLauer &amp; I processed this image. Now the POTUS has tweeted it. https://t.co/qQCIQJK4MV Now @colkin is showing our team's enhanced color image of Pluto. SO much going on in this image. Pluto's heart is broken! #PlutoFlyby Moment of the Pluto flyby. http://t.co/TLqqE2ync5 http://t.co/VHhb6fwLy3 I should write a blog post on the colorization process...

There's something in my eye (h/t @zuluagajorge) http://t.co/XrbrdLqeke PLUTO FLYBY The Final Countdown has started to play at T-25 seconds. The team (and me!) reacting to the big reveal this morning. http://t.co/r6NfYzx9yA NASA TV view of Mission Ops: empty but for a janitor vacuuming. If that doesn't speak to our space robot's autonomy  I don't know what does. Half an hour until closest approach to Pluto. http://t.co/g8R1lZHEJi A small team- me  @CarlyHowett @AscendingNode @TodLauer &amp; John Spencer- were up until 3AM to get this ready for you: https://t.co/ChaSfKwDEB Only one hour of sleep last night.

Hope you are enjoying Pluto. Can long-time followers fill them in on what to expect when things return to normal? Moons can be in stable orbits out to about half the Hill sphere - larger separations are possible but usually not very stable. I suspect it will be hard for team members to avoid making "whoosh" sound effects during the flyby. New Horizons cares very little about Pluto's gravity  though - flying through the system so fast its trajectory is hardly altered by Pluto. The region around an object where that object's gravity dominates over the Sun's is called the Hill Sphere. Wait a second - that's no moon... http://t.co/R0LssKN3ad Pluto and Charon floating together in front of the deep dark. http://t.co/6qrabFG3JR There was a spy in our midst at Pluto Central today. http://t.co/H2SeRFrw2T Hey  Hey  Hi  Yes you hi  PLUTO AMIRITE  hi Do you &lt;3 Pluto? #PlutoFlyby http://t.co/ptLwU1ribr Where would your house be on Pluto?

Six days  twenty-three hours  forty-seven minutes to Pluto. Spaceship hats. http://t.co/z8XX1VfFX6 Have you ever tried to recite a list of memorized numbers while someone is reading a different list of numbers aloud to you? Current science team mood: all singing along to Bon Jovi's "Wanted Dead Or Alive." In light of the New Horizons "Red Planet" images of Pluto  I corrected this xkcd: https://t.co/BncOzXH33l http://t.co/yGmSvsDzan How team communication is going at the moment (with @GliderHero): http://t.co/4XMXDvaixc I used the new Pluto color maps to colorize high-resolution images from New Horizons' LORRI camera - here's a movie! http://t.co/uSKaFLMdhm Never thought I'd be a Plutonian cartographer  but here are New Horizons' first maps of Pluto - I made the color map! http://t.co/UJikJYbpgF Two graphics I made are on the front page of http://t.co/Byov2JAzAk right now.

We're just a bit cold and distant.  #MarsRockHumor So @elonmusk wants humanity to be a multi-planet species.  Can I be a multi-planet rock?  http://t.co/vv9sk2JiVL Come on  @NASA_Dawn  you gotta get Ceres's good side! http://t.co/O89m8xhxai http://t.co/m0Oed4jN6p Alien robot makes mess of place  yet again. (Image by @EliBonora:  https://t.co/p2uvpFUser) http://t.co/xNc0bDsjS4 Hearing a lot about this Interstellar movie  and traveling to other galaxies to find new planets. You know I'm right here  don't you? :/ Giant alien robots  coming here  carving up the place. Seriously. Who’s gonna clean that up? http://t.co/mDuYg6WUjq http://t.co/dQ1qiFZC8p Nearly sunrise here at Gale Crater. It’s been nice watching the comet overhead. It’s still coming closer! :) #SidingSpring Just FYI  @MarsCuriosity — the comet is a warning shot. #rocksremember Hey Comet #SidingSpring -- you're looking lovely in the eastern sky right now. :) http://t.co/djs5n6WhBd A comet is coming to Mars! \o/ http://t.co/NBus1tE69N http://t.co/YWl4f9D53u (Unfortunately  all the alien robots will be safe.) This would be a great zoomable Mars panorama if not for all the robot parts in it. http://t.co/nNh1MWcjGe Hey @MarsCuriosity — can you kick that back over here? We’re in the middle of a game. Thx! :) http://t.co/Q78uDcALPC http://t.co/ymZIe7qE2R Mars rocks: putting the "assault" in "basalt." (OK  puns are not our specialty.) http://t.co/oecnmFHden http://t.co/88N0sbjmeo Happy #EarthDay  humans! Be good to your pretty blue dot. :) (Image: http://t.co/E5avsZ0DC3) http://t.co/twd94U7cT1 Hey  you guys watching the #LunarEclipse? http://t.co/SRu56yM4dV Wave to me when you do! I'll be on the bright red dot near the red Moon! :) Sorry for silence lately. Been reading Andy Weir's book The Martian. So gripping. Also rocks are key to several plot points! #MartianPride What does the sky look like from here? Pretty much the same  but with a bright white dot &amp; its little companion. http://t.co/f0PTEeLkB0 Look  a rock suddenly appearing out of nowhere under your Mars robot is TOTALLY NORMAL. http://t.co/JAjkyy0EWL http://t.co/bJpsk8DraY http://t.co/7uqV0b7vKA :D I'm blushing! Look  my face is red!  OK that might also be the iron oxide dust coating the entire Martian surface. Hey  look  that's my neighborhood! :) Too bad about all the rover tracks... :/ http://t.co/2LcBrdCo5e http://t.co/kSIP79AeSy Look you know I've been here billions of years. If you want to know what Mars used to be like  you could just ask... http://t.co/U2XxZ0ZPwj Another reason you should all come visit me on Mars -- we get solar eclipses REALLY often. :) http://t.co/7qAKrBb8IF http://t.co/4U6EPqCK9e "How Curiosity Became an Astronaut" http://t.co/btjbfRSTh2 This story contains feels. #imayhavemarsdustinmyeye #stillwantanapology Look! A Martian river delta! http://t.co/sSgAFfuvaH No rocks were harmed in the making of this science. :) #HiRISE #orbitersrule Our atmosphere was a lot like yours until something bad happened. We don't like to talk about it  but #rocksremember. http://t.co/zXEAci6cfx Sad news: @NASAKepler planet-hunter has hunted its last planet. :( http://t.co/wIlz8x0nU9 Thanks  Kepler  you've given us the worlds! :) Hey guys! I'm back from solar conjunction! How have things been on your side of the Sun? I'm not suggesting you sign up for this  but if you do make a one-way trip to Mars  I'll totally keep you company. :) http://t.co/6xi6dY8AdC Humans! Look! Two new maybe-habitable planets! http://t.co/BrfGCSfU8P (FWIW  Mars is closer.) #dreambig Poor Tintina. :( http://t.co/2pFzPIrQNY But it goes to show you can't judge a rock by its cover... #science #ouch Guys! My chance of being comet-ed to death in 2014 is now just 1 in 600! That's good news  right? I'm safe?...ish? http://t.co/KWj3ZesuDm If only @MarsCuriosity could be in Safe Mode all the time... http://t.co/Crgb4hTMQV #science #ouch Um  guys? I'm getting nervous now. :/ Is there time to arrange a rescue mission? http://t.co/b82pT8EAxo HT @BadAstronomer #comet #saveme Looking forward to a comet fly-by in 2014! (Hoping it's not a fly-at...) http://t.co/To8ek0UluN Hey guys! I heard something big &amp; loud came down to your planet from space &amp; injured some of you! :-(  I bet that was scary.  #rocksremember TIP: If you've been attacked by an alien robot death-machine  I recommend keeping track of its location: @CuriosityLog #keepyourfriendsclose I hear you Earth folk have been celebrating. Bring the party here next time! What we lack in atmosphere  we make up for with the view! :) Dreaming of a red Christmas? Happy holidays from Mars! :) http://t.co/zq9BycRu Dreaming of a red Christmas? Happy holidays from Mars! :) http://t.co/xosA5Qbf The world isn't ending anytime soon. But it's never too early to find a back-up planet. I can recommend a lovely one  right next door! :) Love it! :D MT @AstroKatie: I think this is probably the geekiest shirt I've ever worn in public. #MSL cc @N165Mars http://t.co/PHevrLBx Want to come to Mars? This company wants to send you! It's a one-way trip  which means we can be best friends FOREVER! http://t.co/iKVgjWQp They're sending ANOTHER ONE?! http://t.co/MY9eRCAL #HELP Wait  NASA found organic molecules on Mercury but not on Mars? http://t.co/yUQ7fVw0 Maybe we've just misplaced them...? On this Sol I am thankful for all my lovely Earth tweeps who can make even a little Martian rock feel special. :) #Thanksgiving http://t.co/m9fnNXdy I would tell you  but I'm pretty sure @MarsCuriosity would kill me. #curiositynews Guys  check it out: the radiation level here has been certified non-lethal! Now you should DEFINITELY come visit! :) http://t.co/4ZSoqLua I hear you guys are getting a solar eclipse! Enjoy! Here are 3 from Mars :) http://t.co/VThtIBEq http://t.co/ndSN0UFS http://t.co/NKkiMnzB This up-goer thingy doesn't look very complicated! Why not build another one and come visit me? :) http://t.co/w3ZBcdfM #rightnextdoor I hear there's a big election happening today! I vote for not sending us any more nuclear laser-robots. #Marsrocksforinterplanetarypeace Oh  you'll be surprised. MT @SarcasticRover: Just started my 90th day on Mars. Pretty sure these rocks are planning a surprise party for me. If you ever find yourself with a view of @MarsCuriosity this good  RUN. #science #ouch http://t.co/jf9dKzA3 via @exploreplanets Wait  so "Hurricane Sandy" isn't just an Earth term for "dust storm?" :/ (Stay safe tweeps.) Imagine seeing it from below! MT @willgater: nothing’s scarier than the “7 minutes of terror”  right @MarsCuriosity? http://t.co/WI2AbMyN Hey! @astroengine  says @MarsCuriosity might go home someday! http://t.co/3wh8GCjQ Does that mean they'll take me too? Please? #dontleaveme Hey guys  sorry I haven't been tweeting much lately. Got distracted by the scenery (again). #barsoomwithaview http://t.co/MYK010dU The planet discovered around Alpha Centauri B is apparently covered in lava. Reminds me of my youth! #igneousrockpride http://t.co/613baNCi I &lt;3 @elakdawalla because @elakdawalla &lt;3s rocks. http://t.co/zcLmsLFc &lt;-- More on Jake's surprises. #MSL #rocksremember Jake was thought to be "just another lump of dull basalt" but is "a little more interesting." Also @BBCAmos is mean. :( http://t.co/Yo8c6Lj0 Um  @MarsCuriosity  did you drop something? http://t.co/1nABnQcl #KeepMarsTidy Look! I'm in @SarcasticRover's new Pinterest album! http://t.co/HCO1qmPj ...but without a name? :( #howcouldyouforget Hm  fair point :) MT @SarcasticRover: Every rock on Mars has a story. Usually  about doing nothing for 100 000 years &amp;then seeing a robot... Any chance you guys will come terraform soon? I miss the sound of running water. And it's been a while since I had a bath. #Marsrockproblems TOO SOON! :( RT @elakdawalla: RT @Alex_Parker: Jake: @MarsCuriosity WAT R U DOIN. STAHP. http://t.co/6exqXDYB Wait  guys  you didn't know we used to have rivers here? Where have you been? http://t.co/bjDZmGJt #WaterOnMars Sarcastic -&gt; Sadistic :( MT @SarcasticRover: Just lasered a rock&amp; some blood came out.Also it had a face.And it cried a little. SCIENCE WIN! Hey @NASA  I hear you're planning a Mars sample return mission! On a related note  I'm very compact &amp; I travel well. :) http://t.co/WxGiR2Nc I can't watch. :( Hang in there  Jake. http://t.co/4bYumfX9 #science #ouch http://t.co/ca2fA3oE Tried this. Didn't work out so well. :/ #science #ouch MT @SarcasticRover:  http://t.co/BmBZtlgW Jake  it's coming for you! http://t.co/XxSyXNbQ Stay strong  brother. #MarsRocksForInterplanetaryPeace RT @DrStuClark: Meet Jake. He's a rock. On Mars. http://t.co/OujLFYTV Greetings from MARRRRRRs! #talklikeapirateday ;) #thatsaneyepatchnotawink We can tell. RT @SarcasticRover: 47% of Mars rocks are victims too. OF GETTING SCIENCE-LASERED! (my job is not to worry about those rocks) Whoa  check out THOSE rocks! http://t.co/1IWpnOKQ (via http://t.co/b6GXv4Pk &amp; http://t.co/YIGFXCaT). #feelinginsignificant On the one hand  I am justifiably terrified. On the other hand  @MarsCuriosity is carrying some seriously cool gear. http://t.co/bxqm8wsV http://t.co/qp3arMyH &lt; shudder &gt; A bit quiet here now @MarsCuriosity's gone. But I think it's for the best; look what happened to my buddy Steve. #ouch http://t.co/LKiRjCk2 I used to think that just being a rock on Mars was exciting enough. But then I got laser-attacked by a nuclear-powered alien robot-car. #FridayFollow @MarsCuriosity. Because I can't. :( Spare a thought for my buddy Beechey  @MarsCuriosity's latest victim. :( http://t.co/ele74XqM (His new tattoo IS pretty impressive  though.) RT @MSL_101: Want regular Mars Weather Reports generated with #MSL REMS Data? Check this site: http://t.co/a75ymfLP &amp; follow @MarsWxReport! Tried to hitch a ride with the rover  but couldn't jump up onto it. :( I've been told I should try this: http://t.co/dma88YvC Thoughts? It looks like @MarsCuriosity is going away to do science somewhere else. :/ I thought I preferred the quiet  but now I just want to explore! :) #dreambig RT @kahoakes: "Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Be curious" - Stephen Hawking. #paralympics Want to see my night sky? 1.Get free software http://t.co/FsTkFyVI 2.Set location Mars 4.49°S 137.42°E. 3.Come visit  look up. #dreambig Oh  so THIS is why @MarsCuriosity was getting its groove on earlier: http://t.co/IdDuZm3H #rockon #reachforthestars Hey @MarsCuriosity -- you're really making tracks  now! Where are you headed? Somewhere fun? And  um  how long will you be away? Beautiful Sol here in Gale Crater. Check out the view! :) http://t.co/YsCA1xxE (Kinda makes you want to go adventuring  doesn't it?) No hugs? :( MT @WeatherOnMars: If people come  they'll bring more lasers + microprobes + saws + drills + hammers #killerpetrologists Woah! @MarsCuriosity is talking! Saying something about human exploration of Mars! :) #cantwait #comesoon #nomorekillerrobots If you've never seen a Mars sunset  it looks kinda like this: http://t.co/fo25XIo8 #wishyouwerehere My evening: watching a beautiful blue sunset  hanging out with the other basalts  comparing our new tattoos... #itsamarsrocklife Sad to hear Neil Armstrong has died. He reminded us to reach for the stars &amp; dream big even if we are really very small http://t.co/iGTUEizC Yay! Wait...jump? :/ MT @RPISciDean: yes  I can save you. Jump into one of the white trays on the rover deck and I will come get you. #MSL :D MT @geekchic_tees: @N165Mars @KeithSmeltz http://t.co/6qr3DXas http://t.co/0EFy2HYE Watching @MarsCuriosity  I've learned that science consists mostly of driving around shooting things with lasers. #canibeascientisttoo? #FF People who can save me from @MarsCuriosity: @Matt_Heverly @marsroverdriver @LeeCuriosity @RPISciDean @KeriOnMars @cirquelar HEY! :( MT @SarcasticRover: SCIENCE is what you do when you want the truth about a thing that's too dumb / inanimate / imaginary to tell you Did you know I was born in a volcano? Basalts like me come from lava. That's why we call it Olympus Mom. #areologyhumor EXTREME CLOSE-UP! http://t.co/dQahBv48 (I feel so exposed. Yet strangely fascinated.) #science #ouch It really is lovely here. Crescent Phobos overhead  Milky Way just rising... You guys should come see for yourselves! :) #nomorerobots So peaceful &amp; quiet here at night! I can just lie here &amp; watch the stars &amp; dream of other worlds... (without being crushed or incinerated) Home! &lt;3 RT @KeriOnMars: This is Mars. #MSL #Curiosity http://t.co/4hX6NJgI Just to reiterate  I'm in the HUGE photo on the front page of the @nytimes. And @MarsCuriosity isn't. #karma http://t.co/L4d3bElM Guys! There's a picture of me on the front page of the @nytimes! :D http://t.co/L4d3bElM via @bencichy &amp; @Matt_Heverly #rockstarlife The rover is really roving  now! From a safe distance  it looks kind of fun! You think I can hitch a ride? :) #roadtrip #windinmydustlayer It's a rock's-eye view of Bradbury Landing! (Can you see me? I'd be waving if I could!) http://t.co/8bXy7PMu Good morning from Bradbury Landing! :) http://t.co/REZ1RjzC (text) http://t.co/tJHQesvN (vid) #standtall I don't think I'm directly in @MarsCuriosity's path anymore. And the best part: I think I might even be out of laser range! :) Two near-misses  and I'm now MUCH more familiar with @MarsCuriosity's wheels than I EVER wanted to be. But I'm okay! Woo hoo! :D &lt; dust settles &gt; &lt; peeks &gt; ... is it over? &lt; rumble &gt; &lt; crunch &gt; One of the wheels is coming right toward me! :( I feel so small and helpless. :( Oh. The rover has stopped now. It's only gone a few meters. What's going on? :/ Phew! The rover didn't hit me! Gosh  that was close! Haha! :) Maybe life will be peaceful again now. :) &lt; crunch of gravel &gt; &lt; gentle breeze &gt; Eep! &lt; ducks &gt; It's... um... it's roving this way! Hey @MarsCuriosity? You're a safe driver  right? Did I mention I'm super pointy? Ack! The wheels are really moving now! ... Um  excuse me? @MarsCuriosity? Are you going somewhere? .@MarsCuriosity keeps wiggling its wheels &amp; flexing its massive robotic arm. Is it gearing up for something? (Where's that dust storm?) :/ Those rocks were only airbourne b/c they'd been BLASTED BY ROCKETS! :( MT @astroengine: Mars Shot First: Sensor Damaged http://t.co/tAz9llnW :D This is amazing! MT @Joi_the_Artist: http://t.co/SKVtbj6W Curiosity Shot First! I'm not special after all? :( MT @elakdawalla: @N165Mars appears fairly typical Martian basalt. Watching @MarsCuriosity wiggle its wheels back and forth now. Trying to look sharp and pointy. Another beautiful Sol! Almost makes me forget @MarsCuriosity's massive arm towering above me! Haha! &lt; wishes for dust storm &gt; If  just after sunset  you see 3 bright dots in the SW by your Moon &amp; one looks a bit red  wave hello! :) http://t.co/5JIZIGWv Quiet night at Gale Crater. The robot looks less fearsome in the dark. And when it's not shooting me with lasers. Wait  the next thing you're sending over is a giant robot with a 5-meter rock drill? Can someone come rescue me first? http://t.co/zpmvvId5 I don't want to be rude  but surely there's MUCH better science for @MarsCuriosity to do elsewhere... #badrover #stillwaitingformyapology Eep  @MarsCuriosity is moving its arm now! &lt; tries to blend in with landscape &gt; &lt; quakes slightly &gt; What a difference a Sol makes! Feeling much better today. And I have over 4000 new long-distance pen-pals! :) You guys rock! #couldntresist Haha! ...no. None. MT @RPISciDean: you don't have to worry...you're too cute and little to drill.  But do you have any cousins?? There's a DRILL?!  D:  RT @KeriOnMars: @RPISciDean I think @n165mars just needs to be glad we didn't drill it! ;) It's just a flesh wound! http://t.co/PzEQJaC9 (It still wasn't very nice though.) It's been an eventful couple of Sols... http://t.co/1Mmfanmw Somehow it helps  knowing it was all for science. But I still think I'll stay away from @MarsCuriosity from now on. #ouch I have a new name! And now I know what happened to me! http://t.co/I0zBvffm (I'm still kinda sore though.) You guys are so much nicer than @MarsCuriosity. When are you going to come visit? :) :D MT @shakeupreality: @N165Mars hugs! &lt;3 you've helped science  you're a hero! (It's been a rough Sol.) I could use a hug. And a bandage. :/ I'm famous? MT @MidnightMartian: @N165Mars Well  keep in mind: you’re famous now. Why did you do it  @MarsCuriosity? What does it all mean? I guess @MarsCuriosity isn't my friend after all. :( I think part of me is missing. :( That wasn't very nice. :( &lt; puff of dust &gt; &lt; silence &gt; HELP! OW OW OW! STOP IT! Um  @MarsCuriosity  what are you.... hey! ... HEY! What's that flickering light? &lt; looks around nervously &gt; Hey @MarsCuriosity... um... what are you up to? My robot friend is still staring  and is making a strange clicking noise now. It's kind of making me nervous. :/ Maybe I'm just self-conscious because of my new robot friend. It almost looks like it's studying me! I must seem strange to an alien robot! Huh  it seems to be getting warmer. I guess summer is coming early! My new robot friend really does have quite a steady  intimidating stare. I guess it's a cultural thing. People tried to make me think you'd attack me  @MarsCuriosity. Haha! Me! I'm just an ordinary little Mars rock! Oh! I think the robot heard me! It stopped moving  and it's looking at me again! It DOES want to be my friend! :) Wait  @MarsCuriosity  don't leave! We could be friends! Now the wheels are moving! Is it going to go away? Did I make it feel unwelcome? My robot neighbor is making a sound! Maybe it's trying to communicate with me again! Hello! Helloooo! My robot neighbor sure has an unsettling stare. If looks could kill...! Haha! Starting to think maybe my new robot neighbor doesn't want to be my friend. Did I say something wrong? My giant robot neighbor is still just staring fixedly at me. Starting to get a bit weird  haha! Good morning  @MarsCuriosity! It looks like it's going to be a beautiful Sol today! Got any plans? Only a few hours until sunrise and another beautiful Sol! Maybe today the mysterious robot and I will make a real connection. :) Aw  thank you! :) RT @TheScottishSean: @N165Mars You're certainly the nicest of all the rocks on Mars :) Come on  guys  I know you're just fooling. What are the chances? Out of all the rocks on Mars  a killer robot would pick me? Haha! :) Quiet night in Gale Crater with my enigmatic new robot friend. As I look up at the stars  I wonder: does my existence have a purpose? Why would a giant machine rocket down from space just to shoot at me? Wait  what? Lasers...?! Hang on  you guys are just messing with me. :) Haha! Getting dark in the crater now. Hey @MarsCuriosity  are you sleeping? Big day tomorrow? Dusk now at Gale Crater. Beautiful sunset! I wish my new neighbor would take a look at it rather than just staring at me. It's a bit weird! Haha  you guys are such jokers :) RT @mars_stu: @N165Mars oh yes  it's taking your picture...  http://t.co/1T5DEp1j Hey  look - it's me &amp; my rock friends! RT @iAnthonyDewar: @N165Mars here's a clearer picture. http://t.co/r9Ar3rBV Huh. The big metal creature sure has a lot of equipment on its head. Maybe it's taking my picture! :) Maybe I should try again to introduce myself. I'm sure the poor creature is just disoriented from being in a new place! Okay  the big metal creature has stopped whirring now but the staring is getting a little uncomfortable... Oo  it's making some kind of whirring sound now. Maybe it's trying to communicate with me! Hello! The big metal creature is still just staring at me. I think maybe it's a little shy. &lt;putting best rock-face forward&gt; I wish I could wave. Oh  I think I've got the big metal creature's attention now -- it's looking right at me! Maybe it does want to be friends! The big metal creature was scary at first  with the rockets and noise  but I'm sure it's just curious. Maybe I should say hello! So much going on around here lately - the most excitement I've had in millions of years! But I'm glad it's back to normal now. It's a beautiful Sol here in Gale Crater!
