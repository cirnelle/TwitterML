Like a jar of Nutella¬Æ. The heart wants what the heart wants. And when the heart wants Nutella¬Æ  give it a listen. A good man may be hard to find  but a good jar of Nutella¬Æ is hanging out in most grocery stores. When life hands you lemons  trade them in for a new jar of Nutella¬Æ. What‚Äôs the best thing since sliced bread? Spreading Nutella¬Æ on it  of course. Need a fresh beginning for Spring? Open up a new jar of Nutella¬Æ. Don‚Äôt cry over spilled milk  it‚Äôs not spilled Nutella¬Æ. Sharing is caring. Remember  there‚Äôs no ‚ÄúI‚Äù in Nutella¬Æ. Need a purpose in life? Tell the world about Nutella¬Æ! Love for Nutella¬Æ is too powerful to explain. It‚Äôs like trying to explain the sun or where unicorns come from. Know what goes good with Nutella¬Æ? Pajamas. They say good things come in small packages. Actually  Nutella¬Æ comes in lots of sizes. All good things come to an end‚Ä¶except Nutella. Luckily  there are more jars at the grocery store. A keeper is someone who's willing to share their last bit of Nutella¬Æ with you. Nutella¬Æ doesn‚Äôt mind public displays of affection‚Äîespecially if it involves Nutella¬Æ. Roses are red. Violets are blue. If there was only one jar of Nutella¬Æ in the world  it goes to you. Nutella¬Æ + Roses = A Valentine‚Äôs Day Dream Come True All you need is a little love‚Ä¶.and a bit of Nutella¬Æ. Cut to the chase on the first date.
