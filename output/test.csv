Scheduled access to the LHC tunnel is on the cards for today then back to commissioning CERN,LRT
There was press conference earlier in the day taking stock of what happened over the weekend CERN LHC,LRT
That was good night for the LHC with periods of quiet beam Next step same again for the other beam,LRT
Yes the trick is the concentration of energy in tiny tiny tiny tiny particles Now let move to step particles enter the LHC CERN LHC,LRT
ALICE experiment records splashes as well CERN LHC,LRT
Back to GeV the extraction energy from SPS Crushing nut easily involves more than GeV of your energy So where is the trick CERN LHC,LRT
Live update on restart of beams the LHC is preparing for injection from the SPS CERN LHC,LRT
step protons are sent to SPS the last circle before the LHC few turns to increase the energy up to GeV Do you know how much is it,LRT
rd step protons are sent to circular accelerators PSB and PS it were bunches are prepared The energy increases And then CERN LHC,LRT
In reply to some tweets there is no issue with any single dipole at LHC Teams are simply improving the calibration of the protection system,LRT
nd step protons are accelerated in LINAC linear accelerator Their energy starts to increase And then CERN LHC,LRT
Some info about how we make beams for the LHC protons are produced by stripping electrons from hydrogen atoms This is easy Then CERN LHC,LRT
it in Geneva operators are checking various parameters in the injection chain and the LHC CERN LHC,LRT
Hello everybody this is Antonella tweeting from the CERN CCC The situation is calm here beams are not expected before pm CERN LHC,LRT
Arnaud is going to sleep now and says goodbye Antonella will take over keeping in touch with you guys CERN LHC,LRT
Joking We will go asap to circulating beam again to do some measurements refine and check things CERN LHC,LRT
Meeting just finished Do you want to know what is happening CERN LHC,LRT
