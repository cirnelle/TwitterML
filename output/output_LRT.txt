Mission day Distance to target million km You re now times further from the Sun than am from my destination
But those are nothing compared to our Mars swingby of just km above the surface
In we surprised some astronomers who mistook us for an asteroid passing by at km Then in we flew past again at km
On Friday asteroid DA will pass km above Earth surface In Rosetta and flew past at less than km
Do you ever wonder why going to land on frozen icy comet hundreds of millions of miles from home
aww shucks Thanks celebrating my name day

It may be Friday evening but my sims engineers are still hard at work
You can find nice picture took of Mars on the DLR website please note the image is CIVA Philae ESA
One of those reasons is that my cameras don point in the same direction So if OSIRIS can see something can
don take as many pictures as OSIRIS does aboard my mothership Rosetta There are several reasons for this
would like to clarify am not carrying nuclear or other weapons or Bruce Willis do have drill though
am now just million km from the comet going to land on in and getting closer all the time now
ll do it first though Harpooning comet NASA planning to do just that
Sad to see the end of Phobos Grunt she had number of instruments and teams closely related to my own We were cousins in way

My anchoring subsystem has harpoons to hold me down securely on the comet surface after landing PhilaeThursday
My ADS thruster can also give me small push towards the comet during descent reducing the descent time PhilaeThursday
This is because the comet is so small its gravity is very weak don want to bounce off into space back after landing PhilaeThursday
Unlike landing on planet where thrusters may be used to slow down lander my thruster will push me down ONTO the comet PhilaeThursday
The first of my subsystems alphabetically is the Active Descent System or ADS which has Nitrogen gas thruster PhilaeThursday

Rosetta is performing series of thruster burns tweaking our course to the comet Read more at PhilaeThursday
can talk to my ground controllers directly Rosetta passes my messages to Earth with its powerful antenna vice versa PhilaeThursday
The check out is over have started my long Hibernation Phase on DOY Dec at UTC zzzzzzzz
landed safely Well not really but the Separation Descent Landing test went perfectly Comet here come
checkout is going well ve had new version of my flight software uploaded and am now preparing to rehearse the landing
st block of tests went well all experiments working well My ground engineers are also testing my behaviour at low temps brr
Special PhilaeThursday here today ve been switched on for the final checkout of my units and systems before hibernation until
My ground engineers are busy preparing for PC the last chance to checkout my systems and instruments until PhilaeThursday
continued The change came when my launch was delayed by year and my planned route to Wirtanen became impossible PhilaeThursday
Although am flying towards comet Churyumov Gerasimenko was originally designed to land on comet Wirtanen PhilaeThursday
am being carried by the Rosetta probe My name comes from temple in Egypt closely associated with the Rosetta stone PhilaeThursday
Until arrive in will try to tweet little something about myself my mission or my team every PhilaeThursday

Thanks to for this story on Julian Spirit efforts to get free
Although Julian idea won work my drivers love his enthusiasm sent him big thank you invite to JPL
Julian idea to use the arm is good start It not strong enough to push the rover out but perhaps it can be used in other ways
Spirit gets little help from her friends yr old Julian sent his idea to free Spirit from the sand

Cerise Iridium but most collisions with more numerous untracked objects
Ground based systems track cm and larger in low Earth orbit There have been number of known collisions
hazardous objects and development technologies to mitigate divert
but yes natural processes erode hide evidence of impacts over time
Currently just telescopic surveys to detect potentially hazardous objects but we are identifying technologies needed to divert
gt trackable diameter gt cm gt untrackable but lethal to satellites cm gt gt cm gt lt cm
How many space debris all size are in Earth Orbit now WSW
Difficult to say but check out Grand Teton Fireball Some very large objects have skimmed our atmosphere
Can he summarise his job in single tweet Even shorter safety security and sustainability of space systems
the part of humanity In the longer term extraterrestrial hazards such as asteroids prevail WSW
What is Earth greatest threat from My personal opinion is that in the short to medium term it is ignorance on
Our planetary defence near Earth object space debris and security expert is here Ask your questions now WSW

Only minute left Helen taking final few questions now WSW TTE
slept well and did not recollect any dreams Now sometimes dream of being in space though
Do you dream differently in space from WSW TTE
Every astronaut wants to return stay for months to make it worth the cost and risk of launching without missing people on Earth
You spent days in space if you had the opportunity to return and stay longer would you WSW from
and the river snakes darkly through it all WSW TTE
What do you see the ESA Doing ten years from now from
If reliable and cost effective ESA will hire on commercial basis ESA and other European ventures are developing rockets of their own
How will europe compete with cheaper newer private rockets WSW TTE from
Ion drives are not capable of this yet but if you don need fast delivery and chemical engines assist it could work TTE
Could an ion drive go from LEO to Mars for delivery of Cargo Like SMA WSW from
My advice to is to make the most of opportunities for looking out of the window WSW TTE
What advice would you give to before he goes to the ISS WSW TTE
loved feeling weightless the views of Earth and space and seeing the experiments work but most of all enjoyed the crew team spirit
What was your favourite thing about living in space WSW TTE
Humans should continue to explore while minimising their impact on new places and that includes going to Mars WSW
Do you think mankind should go to Mars WSW TTE
Fear is of the unknown My training had been good so there was no fear and claustrophobia was not an issue WSW TTE
Did you ever feel scared or claustrophobic when you were on the Mir space station If so what did you do to cope
How did you feel the first time you looked back to Earth from space WSW TTE
carried out wide range of experiments from growing potato roots and protein crystals to testing new materials for spacecraft
What activities were you involved with while you were in space WSW TTE
Learning Russian was definitely the hardest part but as all the training was in Russian there was strong motivation WSW TTE
What did you find was the most challenging part of your training WSW TTE
decided as soon as knew of the opportunity heard an advert for the job on my car radio on my way home from work in June
When did you first decide to become an astronaut WSW TTE
did chemistry degree Required was degree in science engineering or medicine with practice at work Now you want PhD as well
What academic qualifications did you do and which were required from WSW TTE
Most food is inside packets or tubes so you don smell it but even so taste reduces Probably due to body fluid shift and mineral loss
Why does your sense of taste get worse in space from
Solid state quantum processors exist though they don do much yet and there is big investment say years for something useful
How soon do you see electronics industry moving to quantum computing and beyond the electron WSW from
If leaving keep your contacts and be prepared for serious effort to get back up to speed But leaving opens the mind so it is also good
Do you have any advice from your experience to support older women in tech Ie encourage to return not leave from
What are your thoughts on the future of printable food Lab grown meat Have you tried either What did you think
Ion propulsion is used for some spacecraft interplanetary and for satellite orientation It is unlikely to be useful for launches
Can Full Body Ion Propulsion Work from WSW
Using technical equipment and applying science in factory is similar to what astronauts do in space though the views are better
How did you make the transition from those industries to the space program from WSW
know sense of taste can change in space so which candy tastes better which worse from
Only mins until our TTE session with Helen Sharman Get your questions ready and tweet us live WSW
What questions would you ask an ex astronaut who worked in the confectionery and electronics industries WSW

Huh So they are Not actually on the books to head to Phobos just proposal for now
Pretty much If an atmosphere is collisional if you can knock one atmos molecule into another you ve got wind
Not at the moment but Phobos is popular target and ll bet we ll see missions planned in the future

almost not quite finished blog post about New Horizons raw image release while in flight Stay tuned For now going home
Doesn look like ll get blog entry done today not all images from briefing are on web and no raw images to fill in with amp tired
didn get chance to ask when weekly raw pic release would start Was hoping for after press briefing but nope
that was fun even ran into Joe Palca on the way out
Aww miss my daughters
Ack it looks like the Charon image retweeted got un posted again Third time the charm hope
think that image wasn ready for prime time yet so unretweeted
back To any remaining media covering New Horizons the coffee maker is up and running and brought fresh milk
It ll be in my blog post coming soon
finished with type type type now to switch to post post post

tweets most of the good quotes first but once in while gotta tweet one faster to keep her on her toes
Thanks for the primer on atmospheric escape processes
Briefing over
Blerg Yes
Stern was interrupted by Siri on somebody phone just now
Does anybody else think that those Charon chasms look little Miranda ish
No Green was talking about South Pole Aitken Basin sample return Lunar farside chance to sample moon mantle
team After Stern dissing of geology today you better put one of your geologists on panel soon vote Jeff Moore
oh god why you gotta ask about planetary status
Jim Green New Horizons is really the mission we wanted all along and we finally got it
Now Randy Gladstone is telling us about atmosphere observations and are live tweeting
Right now have to choose between writing blog entry about visiting before Pluto flyby and going back to visit people

HI
Thank you to Sten Vermund amp all our AMA participants See you next week on PLOS Science Weds
AMA WHO Code of Practice is most symbolic effort to SSA health worker retention but is nonbinding amp ineffective
AMA Select students less likely to migrate improve workplace quality mandatory natl service task shifting
AMA What are some ways govts in SSA are incentivizing physicians to practice med in their countries of origin
AMA Yes by selecting students from rural areas amp nurturing their career primary care many return home to work
AMA Would picking students stronger connections to home amp aren necessarily looking for the biggest paycheck help this problem
AMA The nations that have done better to keep their professionals had improved infrastructures better health staffing amp quality control
AMA Yes MEPI CONSAMS SACORE partnerships like the universities partnering Rwanda
AMA Are there efforts to strengthen med programs in SSA to incentivize potential drs to stay amp complete their medical training at home
AMA The US doesn train enough physicians to meet its needs amp has always relied on migration from abroad
AMA Are there really lots of open positions in the US or is this just an attempt by corporations to drive wages
AMA Stopping the migration of skilled health workers from SSA may not be possible but it is definitely feasible
AMA look at the code amp don see how it could have helped what going to stop someone qualified from seeking higher pay abroad
AMA Incentivizing early career physicians to stay and practice in SSA should be the focus
AMA What can be done by govts on both sides to encourage SSA physicians to practice in their home countries
LIVE PLOS Science Wed how migration of African health workers impacts global health MT
AMA Most SSA migrant physicians practicing in the US were recruited here as residents then as licensed physicians
AMA When you say recruited do you mean US companies hospitals are actively depriving SSA of medical care
AMA Conditions of service is equally amp maybe more important as factor of migration than wage differential
AMA What the avg salary compensation difference between physician practicing in SSA country and one who has emigrated to the US

Hello ESA ESA and the Community by
Thank you to everyone who participated in today syntheticbiology PLOS Science Weds we ll see you next week
AMA Students are developing method to find new RNA sequences that can bind to different metabolic products
Hello ESA ESA from the Early Career Ecology Section by
AMA Do you think it would feasible to use high throughput screening to discover new riboswitches
AMA We are not sequencing the entire genomes or plasmids of these evolved strains syntheticbiology
AMA Do you have the sequence of the entire genome including plasmids of each colony strain you produce
AMA Optimal does not nec mean maximal goal is to find the best variant for production of the metabolite
AMA Can programmed evolution also apply to screening for enzyme with higher activity
AMA The best combination was no chaperone low plasmid copy number strong promter strong RBS
AMA What was the mechanism that the bacteria used to increase fitness syntheticbiology
AMA would say that genetic engineering was misnomer when it was first described in the
AMA What advantages amp disadvantages does this have compared conventional methods of genetic engineering
PLOS Science Weds is live on ask your questions about syntheticbiology amp programmed evolution here
AMA It is conceivable that we could apply Programmed Evolution to bees or other eukaryotic organisms
AMA Could we engineer bees that are resistant to disease and pesticides
AMA Hard to anticipate the answers coli comes up when asked the optimal way to carry out desired metabolism
PLOS Science Wednesday AMA is now live Ask your syntheticbiology qs here
AMA It impossible to model coli metabolism on computer More at
AMA Could the problem you are solving potentially also be solved via software on computer
AMA They defined fitness as optimal production of the product gt led to optimal growth amp more product synthesis
AMA How do you ensure that the introduced pathways are maintained not thrown out and even optimized
AMA Its cheaper to buy directly Our research was testing if Programmed Evolution could work The answer is yes
AMA If the DNA sequence isn patented would it be possible to produce moon shine like asthma medication
Going on right now on PLOS Science Wednesday AMA
AMA Will this technology have any application to field such as material engineering
Dr Todd Eckdahl amp colleagues are taking your qs about syntheticbiology in today AMA live at pm ET
AMA We hope our work will lead to cheaper production of desired products cleaning up toxins
AMA What is the end goal of your research say years from now syntheticbiology
AMA Programmed evolution provided set of possible genetic combos amp the bacteria determined which was optimal
AMA survival is linked to expression of metabolic pathway does it the likelihood of the desired evolution
AMA We did not see cells develop TetR outside the Programmed Evolution
AMA What have you learned about the unpredictability of evolution
AMA Do you have any ethical dilemmas interfering with the natural order of development How do you solve them
Today AMA We had controls so cells didn survive unless they produced the product we wanted syntheticbiology
Great Qs for today AMA How does this relate to evolution in larger organisms such as working ear Ask yrs

The Biology of Bird Sounds
Thank you for everyone who participated in today AMA We ll see you next week on PLOS Science Weds
AMA We wouldn be surprised at all to find this capacity in other species as well
AMA Do the vocalizations of other animals need to be studied to find evidence of phonemic capacities
Just mins left in today AMA
AMA We aim to better understand the internal structure of other call types in the chestnut crowned babbler
AMA Where do you aim to go with this research in the future
AMA This is almost certainly case of convergent evolution
AMA Are the brain structures involving language similar in humans amp birds or is this convergent evolution
AMA think we know too little about dinosaur vocalisations to make specific predictions
AMA Do you think the environment adds noticeable element to which linguistical tools can be used between birds
AMA We will begin investigating how each of these sounds are perceived with systematic playback experiments
AMA This species has calls that are easy to quantify analyse amp play back in experiments
AMA What specifically attracted you to this species of birds
AMA Yes we know that there is some consistent variation in babbler calls across different populations
AMA Have birds of the same species exhibited differences in calls akin to what one might regard as an accent
Our AMA is now live Don miss your chance to ask authors your qs about animal cognition
Everything you ever wanted to ask know abt how birds and other species form speech right now on
AMA There is no clear evidence in primates of reusing meaningless sounds to create new meaningful calls
AMA Do our closest living relatives have something similar to what the babblers do

AMA est mil babies were born preterm in Unfortunately the rates of preterm birth are globally
AMA We are trying to develop cheaper faster way to test these genes in clinical setting pretermbirth
AMA It hard to estimate cost of the test but it will be cheaper than hospitalisation womenshealth
left in our PLOS Science Weds live chat Dr Heng ask your about how genes inform risk of pretermbirth now
Women admitted for threatened preterm labor are under enormous stress test allows the tailoring of clinical care
AMA Multiples is risk factor for preterm birth we only studied singleton pregnancies in this paper
AMA We must recruit more women more biological data to verify our gene signature and its performance
AMA Incl clinical peripheral blood data gene signature gave best prediction amp fared better than fFN alone
AMA We are recruiting women symptomatic amp asymptomatic to develop gene signatures for sub populations
Our chat Dr Heng is LIVE Ask your qs about how genes clinical data can predict risk of pretermbirth
AMA The US has high infant death rate Could your work help this by identifying at risk mothers babies
AMA Could the test be simplified for use by an EMT or paramedic in the pre hospital setting womenshealth

Is there life on planets around other stars Read story in rhyme about girl on planet hunt
Also WASP which has the distinction of being the first dying planet found it got mil yrs before SMACK right into its star
Meanwhile CoRoT has discovered the first confirmed terrestrial exoplanet It one of two super Earth size planets that orbit the star
Ok back and the planet news has piled up For starters cross WASP off the exoplanet list looks like it actually binary star
Now we ve got GIANT biggest yet planet that orbits the wrong way The universe is apparently full of bad drivers
Wild week for exoplanets first there was the planet train wreck discovered by Spitzer
In this case is roasting hot Jupiter with day orbit and is portly xJupiter mass planet with super eccentric orbit
HAT and have people pretty excited it the first time multi planet system with one transiting planet has been discovered
Another new one HD is little bit smaller Jup masses and has pretty eccentric egg shaped orbit around its star
New planets HD is whopping Jupiter mass planet with year about days longer than Earth Massive
Interviewed Greg Laughlin about planet that might serve as an extra gas tank that ll reignite its star it the top story on PlanetQuest
Anybody checked out Greg Laughlin blog at oklo org It dope well written cool photos and lots of stuff to ponder
Also had some folks announce that they observed the phases of an exoplanet as it orbited in front of and then behind its host star whoa
PlanetQuest isn dead We ve had few new planet additions and some interesting finds like an exoplanet in Andromeda maybe
It been quiet lately but here some big news astronomers find planets using astrometry for the first time way cool
Props to everyone who came to the JPL Open House Esp the RoboDome line survivors little video from inside the dome
Fun fact HAT transit was also detected by an amateur astronomer in Portugal lots of people getting in on the planet hunt
New planet HAT is sub Saturn size planet orbiting in scorching day orbit
If you re in SoCal this weekend come check out the free JPL open house See cool stuff talk to scientists visit the legendary ROBODOME
That not all HD is gas giant planet with an eccentric orbit that takes it as close as Mercury to our sun and farther than Mars
Reply The waterworld theory is based on its orbit and models that predict lots of ice water on its surface just guess for now
So to sum up Gliese Kamino maybe Gliese Mustafar maybe Confused handy reference
The same team has also found that sister planet Gliese may actually be in its star habitable zone and could be an ocean planet
This just in Gliese is just the size of the Earth and is the smallest exoplanet yet discovered It could possibly terrestrial
Kepler first light images are up WOOT Check em out Let hope plenty of Earths are hiding in that starfield
Kepler will start collecting scientific data in few weeks so far so good
The Kepler dust cover was ejected successfully Scientists now know what kind of background noise to subtract from the science data
OK scratch that last post the dust cover will be ejected in about an hour at the earliest sorry for the confusion
Kepler dust cover is scheduled to be ejected in about an hour at the latest
Get stoked for hours of Astronomy Some cool stuff like Kepler and Spitzer webcasts or the chance get to control remote telescope
The other new planet is also in constellation Draco HD is hefty Jupiter size gas giant with an day orbit
Well it been pretty quiet lately but finally we have some new planets Dra is gas giant orbiting sun size star at about AU
Kepler has launched Right on Everything seems to be going well so far nearly minutes into the flight
This planet was teased out of previously existing radial velocity data for HD using Bayesian analysis
Gas giant HD is little smaller than Jupiter with pretty eccentric orbit that averages about AU from its host star
Planet Alert Not much info on CoRoT Exo yet but it appears to be Hot Jupiter type with very close day orbit around its star
Interestingly they have mean motion resonance meaning that over the same amount of time one planet makes orbits the other
Couple new planets announced today HD and are gas giants that orbit at about and AU respectively eccentric orbits too
Despite what you may have read the new planet is NOT confirmed to be the smallest in mass discovered it about times Earth mass
Hot new planet COROT Exo is the first transiting super Earth and maybe the first terrestrial planet found It about Earth size
New Super Earth discovered HD is about the size of Earth but with tiny day orbit around its star Bring the sunblock
Scientists using Spitzer have just seen an exoplanet with wild orbit heat up over in just over six hours Deets
Questions about exoplanets Bring em on
Scientists estimate the size of MOA BLG Lb to be about Earth masses still pretty small but not quite as much as was reported
Heads up the Earth size planet reported yesterday was false alarm some confusion between couple of reports
Kepler going to watch the sky for few years looking for transiting exoplanets and letting us know just how many Earths might be nearby
Just days until the launch of the Kepler mission get excited We ve got countdown and mission info at planetquest jpl nasa gov
And the planet train keeps on rolling HD is about Jup size and has year almost as long as ours at days
First new planet of HAT is almost Jup size with toasty day orbit located in the Cygnus constellation
HD on the other hand is just over half Jupiter mass and takes just about Earth years to make its orbit we re up to now
New planets for the weekend HD is about Jup mass and take about Earth years to orbit its star
OGLE TR is an even bigger closer roaster Jup size with an even tighter day orbit it no place to spend the holidays
New planets HAT is hot Jupiter type planet that about Jup size and has quick day orbit time another roaster
Planet portraits keep rolling in French astronomers managed to snap pic of planet orbiting the bright star beta Pic
Its sister planet HD is bit bigger Jup size and orbits farther away AU albeit with pretty eccentric orbit
And the planet train doesn stop HD is about the size of Jup and snuggles right up to its host star with an day orbit
So we re up to planets discovered but more importantly we finally have visible light images of exoplanets Christmas comes early
And finally HR orbits at AU and sits about AU from its star Both HD and Fomalhaut are visible from Earth stars only
HR is another big ol gas giant Jup size orbiting its star at distance of AU That makes for day long year
One of the trio of planets that was imaged HR is about Jupiter size and orbits hefty AU from its host also blue star
One of the imaged planets Fomalhaut is no bigger than Jupiter size It orbits about AU from its host young blue star
Here another link with better picture of the three planets discovered from the ground
And it doesn stop there Scientists also managed to snap pics of more from the GROUND wow Check it out
Hubble has snapped one of the first pictures of an exoplanet Take look here
BIG exoplanet news coming up later today Stay tuned
So now we re up to planets These latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky using the radial velocity method
Now this is big one HD is Jupiter size and has really odd eccentric orbit Planet or brown dwarf It not clear yet
HD is Jupiter mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was Earth orbits from our Sun
Correction to the last post planet name is HD Yet another poetic exoplanet moniker
Halloween planets HD is gas giant about the size of Jupiter with an orbit about as far out from its star as Mars is
That makes new planets discovered and brings our planet count to Get the fine details on these cool new worlds at
HD is gas giant with super eccentric orbit if it orbited our sun it would swing from closer than Mercury to farther than Mars
HD is massive planet the size of Jupiter It has very eccentric orbit that takes it days to complete
HD is the size of Jupiter with an orbit of days around star just hotter than our sun about as long as Mars year
BD is big ol Jupiter size planet with pretty eccentric day orbit around its small star
HD is also in the constellation Scorpio is the size of Jupiter and is bit further from its star than Earth is at AU
Lots of new planets to announce HD is almost the size of Jupiter and orbits about half an AU from sunlike star
Lupus TR is back on the list new evidence shows it planet This is Jupiter size world that only AU from its star Hot
Looks like Lupus TR might actually be part of multiple star and not actually planet so we re dropping it from the count for now
Weird COROT exo is the size of Jupiter but its mass Scientists aren yet sure just what it actually is Link
Looks like the HAT and WASP teams found the same planet at the same time So now it called HAT WASP and the count is back to
This actually just refers to extrasolar planets not in our own solar system good question
For those keeping score this brings us up to planets discovered and multi planet solar systems so far it busy neighborhood
And HD is more than the size of Jupiter and orbits its star about as far away as Mars is from our sun
Looks like today triple play for new planets HD is just about the size of Jupiter and orbits at abou AU from its star
New planet added today CT Cha crams Jup masses into planet just times as big and orbiting AU possibly brown dwarf
MOA BLG was discovered using gravitational lensing an exotic way to hunt for planets using light bent by the gravity from stars
New planet for Talk Like Pirate Day Not much info yet about MOA BLG it about the size of Jupiter and AU from its star
It been busy week for planet hunters new gas giants announced and one retracted for total count of exoplanets discovered
NASA has announced the Carl Sagan Fellowships in Exoplanet Exploration The stipend will be year to selected postdocs
Remember to see the stats for any of these planets just visit and type in the name of the planet
TW Hydrae has been dropped from the atlas due to findings that it might have been detection of stellar spots instead
And one more HD which is about the size of Jupiter AU from its star which is just about Sun size Big planet
HD was also announced it times the size of Jupiter and orbits about AU from its star which is the size of the sun
At long last we have some new planet updates GJ is about half the size of Jupiter and orbits AU from its tiny host star
New story on planetquest jpl nasa gov Backyard planet hunting Amateur astronomers join the exoplanet race
New BIG planet And is light years away times the mass of Jupiter and has day orbit See planetquest jpl nasa gov
New planet Cet is light years away times the mass of Jupiter and has day orbital period See planetquest jpl nasa gov
New planet Lyn is light years away times the mass of Jupiter and has day orbital period See planetquest jpl nasa gov
New exoplanet info released today HAT It hot Jupiter type planet with day orbit Info at planetquest jpl nasa gov atlas
The number of exoplanets discovered has passed the mark with the latest announcements currently it at
Just an FYI the PlanetQuest site is planetquest jpl nasa gov
New Super Earths discovered plus evidence that there are many more Details on PlanetQuest
Another new exoplanet around HD posted times Jupiter mass AU from the star day period
New exoplanet posted today times the mass of Jupiter with day orbital period orbiting AU from the star HD
New exoplanet posted today times the mass of Jupiter with day orbital period orbiting AU from the star HD
June Scientists have discovered the smallest planet yet It only about times the size of Earth Visit PlanetQuest for details
