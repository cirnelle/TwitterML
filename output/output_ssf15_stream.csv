Fri Aug 14 01:21:08 +0000 2015,0,0,We are now learning about the ridiculous processes involved in having to go to the toilet in space (spoiler: locked doors and straps) #ssf15
Fri Aug 14 01:24:20 +0000 2015,0,0,MP has a plan to get herself into space. This plan is basically...  Big Brother meets interplanetary travel! #ssf15
Fri Aug 14 01:25:38 +0000 2015,0,0,Biggest problem for space travel is cost. So  the Big Brother Space Travel idea solves that with reality TV funding.  Seriously.  #ssf15
Fri Aug 14 01:26:37 +0000 2015,0,0,Also  the whole eviction thing... But MP solves this problem by saying the winners get to go home. Losers stay in space. #ssf15

Fri Aug 14 01:31:06 +0000 2015,0,0,The cost of getting 1.5 kgs into space costs somewhere between $70-100k. That's the cost for only 1.5L of water! #ssf15
Fri Aug 14 01:33:03 +0000 2015,0,0,MP: One of the best things about space travel (now) is that you are all from Earth. You just have to work together. Eg. @ISS_Research #ssf15

Fri Aug 14 01:37:36 +0000 2015,0,0,MP: The evolution of scientific ideas coupled with seeing how the cost of any kind of travel eventually drops supports space travel #ssf15
Fri Aug 14 01:42:48 +0000 2015,0,0,MP: So many factors against us potentially meeting other life in space. #ssf15

Fri Aug 14 01:47:17 +0000 2015,0,0,MP: Detecting black holes are tricky because they don't emit light but stars move around them #ssf15
Fri Aug 14 01:47:41 +0000 2015,0,0,MP: So you can detect them by watching the movements of nearby stars #ssf15
Fri Aug 14 01:51:37 +0000 2015,0,0,(On a Big Bang question)MP: The name Big Bang was an insult used to discredit the theory. Similar to 'The God Particle' #ssf15
