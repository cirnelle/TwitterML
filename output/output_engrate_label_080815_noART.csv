earlier in the day taking stock of what happened over the weekend CERN LHC,LRTThat was good night for the LHC with periods of quiet beam Next step same again for the other beam,LRTYes the trick is the concentration of energy in tiny tiny tiny tiny particles Now let move to step particles enter the LHC CERN LHC,LRTALICE experiment records splashes as well CERN LHC,LRTBack to GeV the extraction energy from SPS Crushing nut easily involves more than GeV of your energy So where is the trick CERN LHC,LRTLive update on restart of beams the LHC is preparing for injection from the SPS CERN LHC,LRTstep protons are sent to SPS the last circle before the LHC few turns to increase the energy up to GeV Do you know how much is it,LRTrd step protons are sent to circular accelerators PSB and PS it were bunches are prepared The energy increases And then CERN LHC,LRTIn reply to some tweets there is no issue with any single dipole at LHC Teams are simply improving the calibration of the protection system,LRTnd step protons are accelerated in LINAC linear accelerator Their energy starts to increase And then CERN LHC,LRTSome info about how we make beams for the LHC protons are produced by stripping electrons from hydrogen atoms This is easy Then CERN LHC,LRTit in Geneva operators are checking various parameters in the injection chain and the LHC CERN LHC,LRTHello everybody this is Antonella tweeting from the CERN CCC The situation is calm here beams are not expected before pm CERN LHC,LRTArnaud is going to sleep now and says goodbye Antonella will take over keeping in touch with you guys CERN LHC,LRTJoking We will go asap to circulating beam again to do some measurements refine and check things CERN LHC,LRTMeeting just finished Do you want to know what

Rosetta,LRTMission day Distance to target million km,LRTIt may be Friday evening but my sims engineers are still hard at work,LRTYou can find nice picture took of Mars on the DLR website please note the image is CIVA Philae ESA,LRTOne of those reasons is that my cameras don point in the same direction So if OSIRIS can see something can,LRTdon take as many pictures as OSIRIS does aboard my mothership Rosetta There are several reasons for this,LRTam now just million km from the comet going to land on in and getting closer all the time now,LRTll do it first though Harpooning comet NASA planning to do just that,LRTSad to see the end of Phobos Grunt she had number of instruments and teams closely related to my own We were cousins in way,LRTHappy Friday the th Earthlings Especially

flying and went in straight line through the Sun and could fly in space it would need over years to reach me,LRTcurrently on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth almost million km or million miles away PhilaeThursday,LRTyears ago today my mothership and were wrongly identified as Earth threatening asteroid Today real roid flies past safely,LRTMy distance from the Earth doesn just increase because wenot traveling in straight lines Sometimes the Earth catches up little,LRTComet tails point away from the Sun because theynot caused by movement but by the solar wind radiation pressure,LRTWhen operating each Tx unit is switched on hourly alternately by hardware mechanism to ensure they WILL be turned on,LRTBeing able to communicate with the Rosetta orbiter is vital to my

SpaceTweetup at TdLR in Cologne September gt,LRTzzz It cold out here But all snuggled up in lots of blankets layers of blankets in fact,LRTweigh about Kg but the gravity at my destination comet will be so lowweigh the equivalent of just noodles on Earth,LRTweigh about Kg At its peak of activity in my comet was pumping out approx Kg of dust PER SECOND More at,LRTyears ago just few months after was launched arrived at Saturn after journey which had also taken years,LRTMy scientists are still busy finalising the scientific objectives of my mission Theydivided into themes in page document,LRTactually going to be asleep even longer but only few days more,LRTROSETTA COMET TOUCHDOWN pilot educational project using LEGO,LRTMy ground engineers are in Cologne too too far away to take photo though Cologne Germany,LRTSubsystem is CDMS my flight computer It full of redundant systems to be fault tolerant and runs unique OS PhilaeThursday,LRTMy anchoring subsystem has harpoons to hold me down securely on the comet surface after landing PhilaeThursday,LRTMy ADS thruster can also give me small push towards the comet during descent reducing the descent time PhilaeThursday,LRTThis is because the comet is so small its gravity is very weak don want to bounce off into space back after landing PhilaeThursday,LRTUnlike landing on planet where thrusters may be used to slow down lander my thruster will push me down ONTO the comet PhilaeThursday,LRTThe first of my subsystems alphabetically is the Active Descent System or ADS which has Nitrogen gas thruster PhilaeThursday,LRTof my subsystems were built using advanced technology from crashed alien spacecraft Yes even spacecraft enjoy aprilfools day,LRThave subsystems and am carrying experiment units The SS keep me alive but the expts are the reason was built PhilaeThursday,LRTYay being followed by one of the most famous spacecraft of all time on twitter not in space welong way apart,LRTJust added myself to the twitter directory under space comets spacecraft spaceflight spaceship spaceexploration,LRTMy scientists and engineers will be gathering in Cologne this week for the

are on course for comet after successful Deep Space Maneuver PhilaeThursday,LRTMy engineers scientists are looking fwd to seeing results of Stardust NExT flyby still so much we don know abt comets PhilaeThursday,LRTCongrats to the Stardust NExT team on their flyby of comet Tempel,LRTThe distance between me and the Earth is actually decreasing at the moment can anybody guess why,LRTmy clever science team are still busy analyzing possible descents for me at the comet can safely land at up to km PhilaeThursday,LRTupdate is little late this week sorry,LRTHappy Birthday to my Project Manager Stephan Ulamec PhilaeThursday,LRTRosetta is performing series of thruster burns tweaking our course to the comet Read more at PhilaeThursday,LRTcan talk to my ground controllers directly Rosetta passes my messages to Earth with its powerful antenna vice versa PhilaeThursday,LRTThe check out is over have started my long Hibernation Phase on DOY Dec at UTC zzzzzzzz,LRTlanded safely Well not really but the Separation Descent Landing test went perfectly Comet here come,LRTcheckout is going well ve had new version of my flight software uploaded and am now preparing to rehearse the landing,LRTst block of tests went well all experiments working well My ground engineers are also testing my behaviour at low temps brr,LRTSpecial PhilaeThursday here today ve been switched on for the final checkout of my units and systems before hibernation until,LRTMy ground engineers are busy preparing for PC the last chance to checkout my systems and instruments until PhilaeThursday,LRTcontinued The change came when my launch was delayed by year and my planned route to Wirtanen became impossible PhilaeThursday,LRTAlthough am flying towards comet Churyumov Gerasimenko was originally designed to land on comet Wirtanen PhilaeThursday,LRTam being carried by the Rosetta probe My name comes from temple in Egypt closely associated with the Rosetta stone

tomorrow at BST wswq amp,LRTBut our telescopes and instruments are getting better all the time,LRTMost planets found around other stars so far are bigger than the Earth because theyeasier to detect,LRTHave you found any planets that are similar to Earth Chanez Amaduche MCA,LRTto distort space time But it always mistake to rule anything out and it great that people are investigating such new ideas,LRTdon know very much about it understand that it has some theoretical basis but it would require enormous amounts of energy,LRTDo you place any credence in Miguel Alcubierre warp drive

it won happen for about five billion years,LRTThe Sun will expand rather than explode becoming red giant star and engulfing the Earth in its atmosphere,LRTIs it true that the world will end by the sun exploding When might this happen wswq amp,LRTIt much easier to work at lower frequencies wswq amp,LRTTHz radiation is strongly absorbed by water vapour in the atmosphere and so is not suitable for ground orbit communication,LRTWhether or not THz communication from LEO to ground is achievable at reasonable power levels,LRTwhich still remains the best film about the universe and our place in it,LRTDark Fluid theory is very speculative we can say if it has any validity let alone any uses,LRTWe have no idea about how to travel faster in space without using known physics,LRTCould dark

rhyme about girl on planet hunt,LRTAlso WASP which has the distinction of being the first dying planet found it got mil yrs before SMACK right into its star,LRTMeanwhile CoRoT has discovered the first confirmed terrestrial exoplanet It one of two super Earth size planets that orbit the star,LRTOk back and the planet news has piled up For starters cross WASP off the exoplanet list looks like it actually binary star,LRTWild week for exoplanets first there was the planet train wreck discovered by Spitzer,LRTIn this case is roasting hot Jupiter with day orbit and is portly xJupiter mass planet with super eccentric orbit,LRTHAT and have people pretty excited it the first time multi planet system with one transiting planet has been discovered,LRTAnother new one HD is little bit smaller Jup masses and has pretty eccentric egg shaped orbit around its star,LRTNew planets HD is whopping Jupiter mass planet with year about days longer than Earth Massive,LRTAnybody checked out Greg Laughlin blog at oklo org It dope well written cool photos and lots of stuff to ponder,LRTAlso had some folks announce that they observed the phases of an exoplanet as it orbited in front of and then behind its host star whoa,LRTPlanetQuest isn dead We ve had few new planet additions and some interesting finds like an exoplanet in Andromeda maybe,LRTIt been quiet lately but here some big news astronomers find planets using astrometry for the first time way cool,LRTProps to everyone who came to the JPL Open House Esp the RoboDome line survivors little video from inside the dome,LRTFun fact HAT transit was also detected by an amateur astronomer in Portugal lots of people getting in on the planet hunt,LRTNew planet HAT is sub Saturn size planet orbiting in scorching day orbit,LRTIf youin SoCal this weekend come check out the free JPL open house See cool stuff talk to scientists visit the legendary ROBODOME,LRTThat not all HD is gas giant planet with an eccentric orbit that takes it as close as Mercury to our sun and farther than Mars,LRTReply The waterworld theory is based on its orbit and models that predict lots of ice water on its surface just guess for now,LRTSo to sum up Gliese Kamino maybe Gliese Mustafar maybe Confused handy reference,LRTThe same team has also found that sister planet Gliese may actually be in its star habitable zone and could be an ocean planet,LRTThis just in Gliese is just the size of the Earth and is the smallest exoplanet yet discovered It could possibly terrestrial,LRTKepler first light images are up WOOT Check em out Let hope plenty of Earths are hiding in that starfield,LRTKepler will start collecting scientific data in few weeks so far so good,LRTThe Kepler dust cover was ejected successfully Scientists now know what kind of background noise to subtract from the science data,LRTOK scratch that last post the dust cover will be ejected in about an hour at the earliest sorry for the confusion,LRTKepler dust cover is scheduled to be ejected in about an hour at the latest,LRTGet stoked for hours of Astronomy Some cool stuff like Kepler and Spitzer webcasts or the chance get to control remote telescope,LRTThe other new planet is also in constellation Draco HD is hefty Jupiter size gas giant with an day orbit,LRTWell it been pretty quiet lately but finally we have some new planets Dra is gas giant orbiting sun size star at about AU,LRTKepler has launched Right on Everything seems to be going well so far nearly minutes into the flight,LRTThis planet was teased out of previously existing radial velocity data for HD using Bayesian analysis,LRTGas giant HD is little smaller than Jupiter with pretty eccentric orbit that averages about AU from its host star,LRTPlanet Alert Not much info on CoRoT Exo yet but it appears to be Hot Jupiter type with very close day orbit around its star,LRTInterestingly they have mean motion resonance meaning that over the same amount of time one planet makes orbits the other,LRTCouple new planets announced today HD and are gas giants that orbit at about and AU respectively eccentric orbits too,LRTDespite what you may have read the new planet is NOT confirmed to be the smallest in mass discovered it about times Earth mass,LRTHot new planet COROT Exo is the first transiting super Earth and maybe the first terrestrial planet found It about Earth size,LRTNew Super Earth discovered HD is about the size of Earth but with tiny day orbit around its star Bring the sunblock,LRTScientists using Spitzer have just seen an exoplanet with wild orbit heat up over in just over six hours Deets,LRTQuestions about exoplanets Bring em on,LRTScientists estimate the size of MOA BLG Lb to be about Earth masses still pretty small but not quite as much as was reported,LRTHeads up the Earth size planet reported yesterday was false alarm some confusion between couple of reports,LRTKepler going to watch the sky for few years looking for transiting exoplanets and letting us know just how many Earths might be nearby,LRTJust days until the launch of the Kepler mission get excited We ve got countdown and mission info at planetquest jpl nasa gov,LRTAnd the planet train keeps on rolling HD is about Jup size and has year almost as long as ours at days,LRTFirst new planet of HAT is almost Jup size with toasty day orbit located in the Cygnus constellation,LRTHD on the other hand is just over half Jupiter mass and takes just about Earth years to make its orbit weup to now,LRTNew planets for the weekend HD is about Jup mass and take about Earth years to orbit its star,LRTOGLE TR is an even bigger closer roaster Jup size with an even tighter day orbit it no place to spend the holidays,LRTNew planets HAT is hot Jupiter type planet that about Jup size and has quick day orbit time another roaster,LRTPlanet portraits keep rolling in French astronomers managed to snap pic of planet orbiting the bright star beta Pic,LRTIts sister planet HD is bit bigger Jup size and orbits farther away AU albeit with pretty eccentric orbit,LRTAnd the planet train doesn stop HD is about the size of Jup and snuggles right up to its host star with an day orbit,LRTSo weup to planets discovered but more importantly we finally have visible light images of exoplanets Christmas comes early,LRTAnd finally HR orbits at AU and sits about AU from its star Both HD and Fomalhaut are visible from Earth stars only,LRTHR is another big ol gas giant Jup size orbiting its star at distance of AU That makes for day long year,LRTOne of the trio of planets that was imaged HR is about Jupiter size and orbits hefty AU from its host also blue star,LRTOne of the imaged planets Fomalhaut is no bigger than Jupiter size It orbits about AU from its host young blue star,LRTHere another link with better picture of the three planets discovered from the ground,LRTAnd it doesn stop there Scientists also managed to snap pics of more from the GROUND wow Check it out,LRTHubble has snapped one of the first pictures of an exoplanet Take look here,LRTBIG exoplanet news coming up later today Stay tuned,LRTSo now weup to planets These latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky using the radial velocity method,LRTNow this is big one HD is Jupiter size and has really odd eccentric orbit Planet or brown dwarf It not clear yet,LRTHD is Jupiter mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was Earth orbits from our Sun,LRTCorrection to the last post planet name is HD Yet another poetic exoplanet moniker,LRTHalloween planets HD is gas giant about the size of Jupiter with an orbit about as far out from its star as Mars is,LRTThat makes new planets discovered and brings our planet count to Get the fine details on these cool new worlds at,LRTHD is gas giant with super eccentric orbit if it orbited our sun it would swing from closer than Mercury to farther than Mars,LRTHD is massive planet the size of Jupiter It has very eccentric orbit that takes it days to complete,LRTHD is the size of Jupiter with an orbit of days around star just hotter than our sun about as long as Mars year,LRTBD is big ol Jupiter size planet with pretty eccentric day orbit around its small star,LRTLots of new planets to announce HD is almost the size of Jupiter and orbits about half an AU from sunlike star,LRTLupus TR is back on the list new evidence shows it planet This is Jupiter size world that only AU from its star Hot,LRTLooks like Lupus TR might actually be part of multiple star and not actually planet so wedropping it from the count for now,LRTWeird COROT exo is the size of Jupiter but its mass Scientists aren yet sure just what it actually is Link,LRTLooks like the HAT and WASP teams found the same planet at the same time So now it called HAT WASP and the count is back to,LRTThis actually just refers to extrasolar planets not in our own solar system good question,LRTFor those keeping score this brings us up to planets discovered and multi planet solar systems so far it busy neighborhood,LRTAnd HD is more than the size of Jupiter and orbits its star about as far away as Mars is from our sun,LRTLooks like today triple play for new planets HD is just about the size of Jupiter and orbits at abou AU from its star,LRTNew planet added today CT Cha crams Jup masses into planet just times as big and orbiting AU possibly brown dwarf,LRTMOA BLG was discovered using gravitational lensing an exotic way to hunt for planets using light bent by the gravity from stars,LRTNew planet for Talk Like Pirate Day Not much info yet about MOA BLG it about the size of Jupiter and AU from its star,LRTIt been busy week for planet hunters new gas giants announced and one retracted for total count of exoplanets discovered,LRTNASA has announced the Carl Sagan Fellowships in Exoplanet Exploration The stipend will be year to selected postdocs,LRTRemember to see the stats for any of these planets just visit and type in the name of the planet,LRTTW Hydrae has been dropped from the atlas due to findings that it might have been detection of stellar spots instead,LRTAnd one more HD which is about the size of Jupiter AU from its star which is just about Sun size Big planet,LRTHD was also announced it times the size of Jupiter and orbits about AU from its star which is the size of the sun,LRTAt long last we have some new planet updates GJ is about half the size of Jupiter and orbits AU from its tiny host star,LRTNew story on planetquest jpl nasa gov Backyard planet hunting Amateur astronomers join the exoplanet race,LRTNew BIG planet And is light years away times the mass of Jupiter and has day

capacity to do deep work WCSJ,LRTSome formerly cut rate places are now raising their game doing good journalism says referring to WCSJ,LRTThere at least three hopeful responses underway None are ideal But they giving us good digital journalism WCSJ,LRTrd problem with audience atomization is it creates opportunities for mischief by special interest groups WCSJ,LRTCross cultural conversations are being stifled by this atomization of interest WCSJ,LRTBut even as we are converging in multimedia tools we are diverging in our content Easy to build information bubble WCSJ,LRTIt time when they can tell more transparent vivid contextual stories WCSJ,LRTIncreasingly think the same media convergence will be occurring all over the world WCSJ,LRTIt all sounds pretty grim and yet there are reasons not to lose hope WCSJ,LRTThe emergence of the Internet only made us more confident we thought we knew what tank man wanted WCSJ,LRTremembers the incident at Tiananmen Square We know about it

don know percentages WCSJ,LRTYour editor may say hey want this story It ok to look for other alternative angles Like teen author WCSJ,LRTWho will benefit from these findings Do lot of people have this disease Keep disease mongering in mind WCSJ,LRTAsk were you going on fishing expedition Hunting around to find significant things WCSJ,LRTWhat kind of study was it Observational Controlled trial WCSJ,LRTVan Maanen recommends getting into uni library for paper access But know this can be tough call for many WCSJ,LRTWe ve all gotten used to not trusting corp press releases academic ones have issues too WCSJ,LRTof the time you can find the limitations listed in the paper Some journals put it right in the abstract WCSJ,LRTBut in terms of timing and focus for ebola coverage Not so great Alarm didn grow Til late WCSJ,LRTDid you all do good job covering ebola on balance yes leveraged fear in responsible way WCSJ,LRTNow Oliver Yun from MSF to talk about ebola WCSJ,LRTwas very worried about infection had no insurance WCSJ,LRTIn June there wasn really western interest in ebola WCSJ,LRThas video of an ebola burial There was no dignity WCSJ,LRTUmaru says on the way home to Sierra Leone he going to be quarantined for two weeks for MERS think hes joking hope WCSJ,LRTDidn anticipate how difficult coming home would be Friends and coworkers don want to see you Ouch WCSJ,LRTsays life did continue normally People weren running around screaming WCSJ,LRTthings swung the pendulum the outbreak got worse and public health in Canada sent scientists Local bit helped WCSJ,LRTWorried about being strain on the resources about being the group to bring ebola back to Canada WCSJ,LRTsays tough to get to Africa for ebola trying to get the budget was tough and fear was factor WCSJ,LRTsniff no tea or coffee before session still none Didn get breakfast and now paying the price WCSJ,LRTNeed to be extremely rigorous with everything it not always going to be wrong but youknow if problematic WCSJ,LRTWants to bring back muckrakers place for sci journos to deliver stories about what really going on WCSJ,LRTThat explosion of science pages was wonder of science moment but because easily expendable WCSJ,LRTsays yes at the end of the day you do need to eat and that ok need to be very transparent WCSJ,LRTQuestion as newspaper sections close people move to being PIOs what do you think of this WCSJ,LRTagrees it rough they have an investigative bureau in their uni By raising they fund journalists WCSJ,LRTNow questions Sci journos are being let go how do we fund the journalism you want to see WCSJ,LRTnow asking how much money we are following There may not be anything wrong but we should be able to see WCSJ,LRTThen there the watchdog role who is scrutinizing the way the govt spends money WCSJ,LRTnow covering fraud and misconduct and statistics says we don know how deep the iceberg is WCSJ,LRTSo peer review can be problematic when pressed for time and not able to do it properly WCSJ,LRTWho giving me the quality control had to had to work it out WCSJ on learning how to peer review,LRTwas torn wanted to do it properly and that takes time WCSJ,LRTsays where the accountability There no transparency WCSJ,LRTNow talking about the stem cell debacle asked for the peer review of the paper WCSJ couldn get it,LRTWe know these problem with replication if the foundations are shaky the results aren solid WCSJ,LRTAs result of the pressure science is under its trying to increase boundaries communicate more WCSJ,LRTnow talking about boundary theory When there are pressures sci needs to hold boundaries by communicating WCSJ,LRTnow taking about science media center in the uk which controls access to science info WCSJ,LRTIt about the ideology of being journalists and the tensions we feel in trying to be everything WCSJ,LRTSo say science journalists are acting as modest witnesses as well but Donna Harraway says we have no right WCSJ,LRTquotes about approaching things from many angles WCSJ,LRTis comparing science journalism to hamlet specifically hamlets ghost WCSJ,LRTAudience members says most journos are freelancers not enough scandals to make living WCSJ,LRTAudience members says focusing too much on scandals will lead to that being only thing covered More interesting things happen WCSJ,LRTFinal question should sci journalists work harder to expose frauds and scandals WCSJ,LRTAudience says it should be more society Science is important to society So we need that WCSJ,LRTMartin says we aren just about fraud and scandals we need to educate and communicate as well WCSJ,LRTAudience member says lead with the facts He doesn need human angle other people have that WCSJ,LRTThe right story is one that does both inform and talk about responding so this is about angles WCSJ,LRTviruses biology isn news How korea responds is news WCSJ,LRTSays if you are telling people whether or not to be scared you may feed into hype WCSJ,LRTMark says he write about biology when he in NYC but here he on the ground He can interview people MERS WCSJ,LRTOthers says they want to know about the virus first and should they be scared WCSJ,LRTAnother says it the way you present the story You use people reaction to go into what the virus is WCSJ,LRTMartin says she wants to know the basics before she wants to know the social implications WCSJ,LRTThe next question is my MERS story tomorrow would be mostly on WCSJ,LRTNow with the Internet things have changed Our stories are interesting and we can count how many people care WCSJ,LRTOn to the next question do science journalists feel disrespected by other journalists WCSJ,LRTWhere is the critical deficit Resources to practice journalism WCSJ,LRTFagin says what we need to reinforce is the journalism Says unis etc have their own ways to disseminate info WCSJ,LRTSays with limited amount of resources they need the facts not an angle that make scientists look like bad guys WCSJ,LRTSays we need more journalism to keep our hamburgers alive WCSJ,LRTAudience member says young science journalists lack ability to pitch with structure Need more journalism WCSJ,LRTSays he dislikes the use of lay people and says it condescending WCSJ,LRTWhen there new planet do we need to spend lots of time talking about where the money comes from WCSJ,LRTJack is calling for balance Martin agrees When there is something to dig up dig it up WCSJ,LRTJacks rebuttal we need education but we also need to be watchdogs Says we need to investigate agendas WCSJ,LRTOooh now we are going to debate this like the House of Commons No applause but hear hear and boo allowed WCSJ,LRTMartin says if you focus too much on fraud you may diminish interest in science Nothing but fraud lame sci section WCSJ,LRTMartin says in the current crisis is it feasible for many writers to go deep into every story WCSJ,LRTIf want to focus on policy makers we may focus more on money and fraud but when we write for general public it may be different WCSJ,LRTIn the changing journalism landscape do we need to get away from straight and more into journalism Andrew Jack explains more WCSJ,LRTStill feeling aftershocks He emphasized the role of media in reconstruction WCSJ he says we rise again,LRTHis group set up their newsroom under tent because they couldn go in the building WCSJ family members also with them,LRTHe walked to the office It was dangerous but we had deadline for tomorrow The building was cracked Most houses cracked WCSJ,LRTmedian age is similar to Middle East cases years old for MERS SARS is about years younger Comorbidity WCSJ,LRTthe patient went to two hospitals before arriving at the final one where history was finally taken with travel MERS WCSJ,LRTno intubation of index patient it nebulizer use MERS WCSJ,LRTwas the index patient incubated Reason for spread Also reports that Dr warned ppl warning not acted on MERS WCSJ,LRTare there SOPs for hospitals in Korea yes but need to pay more attention only compliance for hand washing MERS WCSJ,LRTArsenic also in the idea you could get used to poison all the way back to Mithridates we ve dumped that theory WCSJ,LRTSorry guys trying to live tweet but the wi fi doesn like me much WCSJ,LRTsays aresenic trioxide is the most well known poison in our murderous

PlutoFlyby,HRTGrunsfeld to Bowman What is the actual data rate think it lower than Bowman Yeah we wish it was PlutoFlyby,HRTasked if the new image showed evidence of hazes or clouds Stern replied he looked and hadn seen those or plumes yet,HRTXKCD What if What if New Horizons hit my car,HRTThere is lot of applause happening but it feels premature until we hear from New Horizons again,HRTSince it FAQ It will be hours until we hear from New Horizons because spacecraft is too busy scienceing to talk to us right now,HRTPress briefing coming up momentarily But still hours until we find out

compositional measurements show us that the polar regions are compositionally very different from the dark regions,HRTStern People love turning little dots little points of light into planets and writing new textbooks from scratch,HRTGrunsfeld Pluto is capstone of our solar system exploration and also it opening up new realm,HRTStern explains color data is much more expensive in terms of bits to get it to the ground which is why more LORRI pics have come down,HRTStern We tested techniques we used to determine Pluto diameter on Charon and got the right answer radius km,HRTunderstand you have to put miles on graphics for Americans but for love of Pete why can you also put metric measurements,HRTStern We detected escaping nitrogen before expected Either escaping faster than we thought or mechanism is different than thought,HRTStern Pluto radius is km It settles the debate about the largest object in the Kuiper belt,HRTPSA will not respond to any questions comments about

geologically active generally means interior rumblings Clearly frosts move around on Pluto surface,HRTMost are also hoping that Pluto is active just want better evidence If it true weknow soon Also if not,HRTIn current hallway conversations with planetary scientists most are unconvinced by the evidence that Pluto is geologically active,HRTok hard to argue with this one,HRTSure it OK to grandfather Pluto in as planet Also you can grandfather the Earth as flat too if that makes you feel better,HRTll be there at the Planetary Society thing tonight listening for the NH signal Come say hi Throw ice or something,HRTIf youlocallooking for place to geek out on Pluto tonight come to the Planetary Society event in Pasadena,HRTEvery time someone says Pluto looks really interesting thus should be planet Titan sheds an alkane tear,HRTOr maybe not Figuring out if that is plausible requires getting out the pencil and doing calculations Which too sleepy to do now,HRTequatorial ice melting decades earlier Once it starts it spreads around the equator Leaving the heart for last,HRTIs it coincidence that the heart is on the anti Charon side Maybe light from Charon provided just enough extra heat to start the,HRTMy best is that if you came back in years the heart would be gone which sounds kind of sad and dark regions would extend further,HRTBUT the bright patch really shouldnt be at the equator That one of the warmest spots The rest of the equator is ice free as expected,HRTNot surprising to have ice patches coming and going Pluto goes through seasonal temperature extremes so that is expected,HRTThat heart on Pluto sure is odd It appears to be thick ice patch that is being slowing eaten away at the edges,HRTAlso the dark patch at Charon north pole definitely looks more interesting than initially gave it credit for,HRTWatch Charon probably the most similar thing in the solar system to Orcus at least on the surface,HRTOhhh crater rays on Charon Awesome And might the tiny white splotches be my ice volcanoes want ice volcanoes,HRTUseful to keep in mind Pluto size and density in the context of other objects from the Kuiper belt,HRTHey so is it too early to suggest that the big heart on Pluto whatever it turns out to be be named Tombaugh,HRTBack in offered these thoughts on the critical question of whether Eris or Pluto is bigger on,HRTOdd that Eris is tiny bit smaller than Pluto but so much more massive They are quite different bodies in many ways Maybe we should go,HRTgood sign would be that Charon pole is not just darker but also red think weget color info soon,HRTPluto still pretty inscrutable at this distance More resolution please oh you will thanks,HRTendorse,HRTmonth ago suggested Charon would look like Uranus moon Ariel Similarities pretty good so far,HRTWeapproaching the summer solstice after which most of the northern ices might have headed south Process already starting now,HRTIn the fig the solid line shows the latitude of the sun time the dark regions show where the ice has evaporated white is ice,HRTHere figure from that HansenPaige paper showing how Pluto surface ices move around with time,HRTEven now that about all can say Amazing how fast this is all going to come and go and how much we will wish we saw but didn,HRTOn Charon the brightest spots are likely to be ammonia rich water ice flows Dark spots not dark just lack of water flows,HRTOK what about Charon Still too low detail want craters damnit And want them now But will have to wait,HRTConclusions even at this range it is really really hard to learn details of what is going on here Recommendation Go closer,HRTof that sort Your eye is good at playing tricks on you suspect that on the nicely imaged side yousee no giant polygons,HRTWhat are the polygonal features Not polygons Seems unlikely any physical process could form large scale linear features cont,HRTevaporating and going poleward Come back in years and it might look just like the equator Again nicely modeled in HansenPaige,HRTNorth of the dark equator are the patchy tropics Summer has started here recently so suspect this is where ice is currently cont,HRTThe heart could just be random feedback It bright so reflects sunlight so cold so gets icy gets brighter gets colder etc,HRTWhy is the dark equatorial band not continuous No clue The heart looks like the brightest spot on the surface and its equatorial,HRTdark substrate behind Dark substrate is probably tholins Tholins organic muck sorry,HRTby Hansen and Paige who showed how nitrogen evaporates from the warm equatorial regions and reaccumulates at the poles leaving cont,HRTThe dominant feature on Pluto is the dark but not quite continuous equatorial band This was nicely explained in in paper cont,HRTOK friends the Pluto and Charon images are good enough for new round of speculation Let start here,HRTThe latest Pluto images remind me of early adaptive optics images of Titan totally cool and thoroughly uninterpretable Soon though Soon,HRTJust back from vacation What all of this Pluto stuff everyone is talking about,HRTBiggest Pluto surprise to me so far is that New Horizons still hasn spotted any new moons have bet yes,HRTso far nothing on pluto Charon to be surprised about But images are quickly getting better Stay tuned,HRTCharon looks grayer because it too small to keep nitrogen or methane from escaping so only has old water ice on its surface,HRTpeach relatively fresh methane starting to degrade Dark old warm ice free degraded methane,HRTon Pluto darker spots get warmer drove off ices get warmer still drive off more ices etc etc So white cold nitrogen ice,HRTmethane breaks apart and turns reddish when exposed to sunlight and space Pluto is patchy probably because of feedback,HRTTime for your periodic Pluto speculations So far all is as expected Pluto is peach colored because of methane,HRTHappy AsteroidDay day on which you should ponder just how full of crap the people are who are trying to scare you about asteroids,HRTPluto likely mottled because of surface feedback slightly darker areas get warmer drive off ices get darker get warmer get darker,HRTWhy is Pluto so mottled looking Deconvolution will make it appear more so than it really is but we know that it really IS,HRTWhere do ice flows on Charon come from The ancient interior ocean now frozen out but once erupting onto the surface,HRTDark polar cap on Charon Unlikely to be dark ice frost cap but rather lack of bright stuff What is bright stuff Ice flows,HRTPro tip for New Horizons images of PlutoCharon be wary of sharpened and deconvolved images Don believe stuff unless in raw ones,HRTQuaoar Named after the Tongva tribe creation deity who sang and danced the world into existence lt Quaoar,HRTIn case you were worried actually like the real non planet Pluto,HRTICYMI my speculations yesterday on the latest Pluto images have been Storyfyed,HRTTruth is more excited to see Charon suspect it will look something like this,HRTFirst step read little of what we think is on Pluto Even in we had some ideas start around Figure,HRTnot involved in New Horizons so am free to do purely speculative geological interpretaiton starting NOW,HRTAs of today the silly term Plutoid has been used in precisely zero titles or abstracts of refereed papers,HRTHold still Europa Youbeing analyzed this won hurt bit,HRTDear Europa we are about to spy on you We will learn your secrets We are like the NSA of the Jupiter system xoxoxo,HRTNASA might go to Europa within the next decade Methe Keck telescope are going there in about hours,HRTEvery time someone says dwarf planet must be planet because of the name seahorse somewhere sheds salty tear,HRTAnother view The iron is almost mirror like Olive deep green translucent This one was gift from my class,HRTMy fav thinly sliced pallasite translucent olivine Hard to photograph,HRTBeautiful Widmanstatten pattern in this iron meteorite Pattern only forms in frozen cores of mini worlds,HRTThe core mantle boundary of shattered mini world Thanks mini world Sorry about the shattering pallasite,HRTIt chondrules all the way down AKA tiny chunk from the birth of the solar system,HRTThis is an awesome Fukang pallasite Huge olivine crystals,HRTThis No big deal it just PIECE OF THE MOON,HRTNeed to record new SciSolSys lecture today because that damned keeps finding new things on Mars Stop it already,HRTAlso everyone loves those really bright spots on Ceres think these are little more intriguing,HRTOK so the white spots on Ceres are dramatic and mysterious but check out all of those near global scale ridges too,HRTOur biggest sweetest orangest cat has passed Our home is sadder and emptier Also less orange So long Ike,HRTBut the estimate was still wrong The real mass of Pluto is only th of the Earth,HRTzong just found this thing that helps you stay awake at night its called coffee my friends and ill sell you some for one zillion dollars,HRTIt been interesting being here on the big Island listening to people about Mauna Kea The NYT is nicely balanced,HRTOne hour until sunset on Mauna Kea Then weopen up the Keck telescope and begin to understand the solar system little bit better,HRTNice byproduct of observing Europa with Keck is this sweet little image of Jupiter in the guide camera,HRTAMA on Reddit minutes,HRTdoing Reddit AMA on Saturday So you can ask me anything Really Anything at all Wide open Just not about Pluto OK Deal Promise,HRThave theory that using ice from the dark trailing side of Europa would result in the best gintonic ever like to test that idea,HRTThis sounds like it might be really good deal to me Wonder if it ever goes on sale though,HRTLilah was doing tessellations in math today and was all like let me introduce you to Escher and she was all like head explodes,HRTThis Pluto musical almost makes me feel sad for Pluto But Nahhhhhh,HRTGalileo hacked my data Claimed credit,HRTMars is now dead to me just finished recording all of my Mars lectures so have no more to do Mars is actually dead to me,HRTJust submitted telescope proposal with title search for planets in the distant solar system Don tell anyone though it secret,HRTLilah Sigh miss kindergarten Me What part It was just fun weary sigh How come no one told me it was the best time of life,HRTAnyone wonder why all of those bright dwarf planets were discovered yrs ago and nothing much since explain,HRTyrs ago today we discovered Makemake the nd brightest KBO after Pluto It was unsurprisingly nicknamed Easterbunny for awhile,HRTMy free online Science of the Solar System has now begun Students from every continent except Antarctica Anyone there like planets,HRTInterested in Science of the Solar System class but logging in to Coursera is too much work Check out the intro here,HRTMy free online class Science of the Solar System is now LIVE on Courera SciSolSys,HRTWhat The sneak preview to Science of the Solar System drops tomorrow You never heard it from me,HRTlike life on an ocean plate PacificPlateRules NorthAmrericanPlateDrools,HRTHere are your spooky alien jellyfish for the day Youwelcome,HRTDwarf planet Quaoar is named for the creation deity of the Tongva tribe asked their permission first They named the moon Weywot,HRTMauna Kea full of snow But the skies are clear the sun is setting and weoff to discover things,HRTMy mother is in Iceland this week on aurora photography trip So she took this picture Nice timing mom,HRTGoal tomorrow night Discover new never before seen members of the Kuiper belt Then kill them Wait No That not it,HRTHere the talk summary Ceres is weird So Bethany Ehlmann and pointed telescope at it Which showed that Ceres is weird Seriously,HRTOnly weeks until the start of my free online Science of the Solar System MOOC,HRTMikebrown is eccentric oddly inclined and not very bright The asteroid mean Mikebrown Also capable of destroying humanity,HRTOn Titan it only seems to rain hard couple of times decade Which makes it like California only colder And with methane,HRTToo sleepy to tweet it last night but as seen from Keck Titan weather report Yesterday partly cloudy little chance of methane rain,HRTEuropa question for tonight where exactly is all of that hydrogen peroxide coming from We might know the answer in about an hour,HRTdon wanna jinx myself or anything but we found tiny tiny hole in the fog and clouds and are looking at Europa with Keck RIGHT NOW,HRTMe on Ceres The images now are just at that intriguing resolution that lets you make stuff up,HRTCeres and Pluto may become planets again soon Also this just in pigs soon to fly and something about monkeys too,HRTSo this morning she asked me if each baby is different and had the dad genes and the mom how do you get identical twins,HRTMe It just little like kissing OH That totally makes sense Now tell me more about cells and genes and how they work FTW,HRTout of boys genes out of girls but how do the boy and girl cells get together so that they can share,HRTLilah just now How do you make babies Me Boysgirls have cells designed to merge and share the genes together and baby grows,HRTAnd because know you want to know here is the real Sci of the Solar Sys course page With fun preview video,HRTNot bragging or anything yes yes am but SciSolSys is the top rated physical science MOOC IN THE KNOWN UNIVERSE,HRTHey In weeks my free online Science of the Solar System class starts again Last year reviews SciSolSys,HRTBecause everyone sitting next to me on airplanes always asks the Economist explains well why Pluto isn planet,HRTyears ago today the st object in the Kuiper belt was found We mistakenly thought it planet at st but now know its more interesting,HRTValentine dinner Nerd style Oysters in liquid nitrogen,HRTRoses are red Violets are blue Which means got the wrong flowers again Damnit,HRTRoses are red Violets are blue Which is weird cause Shouldn they be violet right,HRTOpening the dome at Palomar Skies are clear Trying to be quiet so as not to spook the whales on Europa,HRTAlso Mars shares beer yayMars,HRTIf Mars images look blurry tomorrow its because most of the Curiosity team is outside my office drinking beer,HRTJames the Giant Peach and measles,HRTheaded to meeting about planetarium show Thus the alien abduction socks seemed like good idea,HRTdon understand the freakout on the east coast It is RAINING in California RIGHT NOW people just got WET raindropmageddon,HRTjust did BBC interview about New Horizons Which is kinda like interviewing John Wilkes Booth about the Gettysburg Address think,HRTHey Chicagoans giving combo talk planetarium presentation at the Adler Planetarium on March th Be there,HRTEvery time standing weekly telecon is permanently canceled an angel gets its wings,HRTAn article in the NYT in which my graduate students roll on the floor and laugh at me Again,HRTAlso kinda sad that nobody commented on my zombie socks all day Attn,HRTTo get to Haumea you go sunward st because you go FAST when by the sun then fire your engines and then Oberth,HRTFun to be in meeting with rockets scientists they say things like oh no that not good idea you probably explode And they mean it,HRTGot st email from my yr old daughter Excuse me while huddle in the corner and silently weep for few minutes,HRTHey my former PhD student Konstatin Batygin is Young Scientists Who is Changing the World says Forbes,HRTFor today th anniversary of Eris discovery we searched the whole sky for more bright KBOs And found some,HRTHappy Solstice Candles on the tree are some of the warmest prettiest things around,HRTThe firefox update that made yahoo search default reminded me that hate yahoo search and it is time to dump firefox TNX,HRTThinking about putting Markov Chain on my Christmas Tree But fear might be marginalized,HRTExcuse me there is water coming out of the sky How do drive The is on it,HRTWanna see all of the dwarf planets of course you do Check out this new page of orbit diagrams and more,HRTTimes like now when see patterns in my data that no one else believes just think of Percival Lowell canals on Mars Always believe,HRTHappy Julian date everyone,HRTcurrently feet above Chelyabinsk Nervously looking up,HRTMy student Patrick Fischer detected huge salty patch on Europa Great talk but couldn convince him to call it Margaritaville,HRTCome on Admit it You kinda wanna go to Hawaii to watch the st ever Keck vs Keck telescope polo match,HRTOh oh Theyon to the Kuiper belt dirty little secret Or big secret really,HRTLilah How come you don have an VOTED sticker Me voted by mail They don mail you back sticker then why did you even vote,HRTToday am dressed up as that mean professor who gives you differential equations midterm on Halloween SPOOKY,HRTpropose new class of objects esteemed former planets Pluto is in but also the sun the moon few dozen asteroids and Eris Yah,HRTgot dressed up to read book about um me at Lilah school book fair,HRTSTOP SAYING PLUTO IS PLANET OR NEXT TIME WILL NOT GIVE THE MOON BACK,HRTThe thirty meter telescope ground breaking is happening When built it will resemble death star,HRTEarthlings Pluto is not worthy of being argued over working on finding something much more worthy Have patience my friends Xena,HRTLilah wants to know if the bobcat would chase laser pointer spot Do you know hard that suggestion is to resist Not Doing It Not,HRTNot bear this time BobCatInBackyard Needless to say the house cats are not pleased,HRTPerfect application of Betteridge Law of Headlines Is demoted planet Pluto making comeback obv answer No,HRTManiacal laugh you have single handedly destroyed my child hood How do you sleep at night Youmonster,HRTMakemake like Pluto is also still not planet Butstill be talking about it at PDT Online here,HRTthought had retired from my role as defender of Pluto as not planet but WILL put on my capemask again and return if have to,HRTJust clarification on the Pluto is planet again news um no it not But thanks for asking,HRTIt was cute to watch the Modern Family episode filmed at tonight no Look The pond Look the colonnades Nice to see home on TV,HRTIf you give rats an injectionTELL your assistants to watch for signs of super intelligence how do we know it was really the injections,HRTMrs Frisby and the Rats of Nimh describes inadvertently but perfectly how to bias your experiment by not using double blind protocol,HRTIf you discovered large abnormally salty patch on Europa what would you call it askingForAFriend,HRTHotTubBears cubs again yawn ThisIsGettingOld Seriously KindaCuteThough okbye,HRTkeep getting confused by NASA ISScrew hashtag each time see it think it the Dept of Defense saying ScrewIS,HRThow long will can of Dr Brown root beer on the shelf above your desk last until it explodes years CleaningMyDeskNow,HRTFirst day of fall or as like to think of it the moment when the opposition ecliptic heads into the north celestial hemisphere,HRTThe galaxies in this neck of the sky are pretty though they really do get in the way of the interesting stuff,HRTWhen said big camera meant BIG This is the CAMERA There is whole telescope in front of it,HRTwith this huge camera on this huge telescope and these nice skies we should have the record for most KBO discoveries in night by dawn,HRTEvery time we open up the telescope and take minute exposure we discover something like new objects in the Kuiper belt,HRTHappy to see MAVEN safely enter Mars orbit It true though that last year in SciSolSys class we declared the acronym to be lame,HRTExcited to be headed to Hawaii and the Subaru Telescope this weekend Observing at Subaru looks sort of like this,HRTthink my hot tub bear is depressed about the possibility of Scottish independence CantGoOn MustGoOn,HRTTomorrow has minutes less sunlight than today At this rate we will have no sunlight at all by Oct BadExtrapolations,HRTFreeman Dyson rolls old school with an overhead projector,HRTMy backyard is now apparently bear spa Bear has just headed back into the woods looking relaxed,HRTOn this day in astronomers admitted what they known for decade Pluto should never have been called planet in the first place,HRTThis bit of sandstone on the far west of vancouver island is one of the last parts to accrete onto America,HRTOK you gotta kinda like the new president of Caltech no,HRTWe ve escaped for the end of summer About to go search for Orcas Warmed up by making one,HRTThe loud but muffled sounds of Eminem from miles out are like seismic tomography If tried hard should be able to map the hills,HRTBest pro tip from talk gave yesterday on giving good public talks get your audience liquored up first if at all possible,HRTCool things from group meeting this morning salty patch on Europa new Trojan asteroids Ethylene and acetylene Productive week,HRTWhat the old maxim The family that dresses up in bunny suits and hangs out in clean rooms together stays together,HRTAlso if you ARE going to fill up balloon with acetylene and light it it is best not to ask permission first ThingsILearnedinHighSchool,HRTyears ago today Lilah was days old had not slept in weeks and we announced the discovery of Eris aka UB aka Xena Crazy,HRTin Napa tonight giving talk titled something like How killed Pluto and why ah forget it and refill my wine,HRTAs rightly pointed out should have just said Thanks America,HRTMe Mommy would be better president than me Lilah She help but you should be prez Me Why Girls aren allowed Thanks world,HRTIn the Germany locker room at halftime,HRTFor the record it was not me,HRTFlying to Stockholm Appropriately my phone speaker finally died so miss it when it rings Yup It the no bell prize,HRTDon let anyone say dumb things about Pluto being planet while gone OK Also someone tell me how the Switzerland Ecuador game ends,HRTMy dad lived the history of manned spaceflight,HRTPallasites are really hard to take pix of Imagine mirror embedded with translucent gems Cause it mostly is,HRTMy online class sent bit of core mantle boundary from shattered miniplanet,HRTpotatoid,HRTHerschel coined aster oid which means star like because asteroids looked like unresolved points Except now they don bloboid,HRTIt kind of crazy that we can just sit here all night at the Keck telescope and take resolved images of Ceres like it nuthin,HRTSeriously people Ceres of course And no won kill it That would make me serial killer of dwarf planets,HRTWhoo hoo Ceres We got images We got spectra We got spectral images We got photons with long wavelengths,HRTunmentioned the combination of wood pig and fire is sure indication of intelligent life SciSolSys,HRTFirst gray hairs spotted on my head Senility imminent Look for tweets about Pluto being planet coming soon,HRTZOMG got to borrow pallasite for today class touching core mantle boundary SciSolSys,HRTThe wikipedia page on asteroid Mikebrown is kind of hilarious They forgot to mention that it oddly inclined too,HRTFor the record Peeps burn better after being soaked in white gas But they do not taste better,HRTYep Nothing good at all FormerPeeps fire HappyEaster,HRTNothing good is likely to come of this peeps fire HappyEaster,HRTUntil today had no idea that Pluto was bit like female penis,HRTLilah just now for the win love you until the end of numbers you can copy and thus discovers mathematical induction,HRTReading Love in the Time of Cholera fabulously and profoundly shattered any delusion had early in life that could ever be novelist,HRTPerhaps it is just easiest to never expect anything useful of me You will not be disappointed that way,HRTOceans on Enceladus Is that covered in my free online class Yup Is there still time to enroll Yup,HRTHere is the full HyperSuprimeCam field with that huge cluster looking tiny tiny,HRTIn each minute HSC exposure we detect new objects in the Kuiper belt As you might guess am excited about this new instrument,HRTHyperSuprimeCam covers crazy amount of sky in each shot Check out all of those CCDs,HRTIt hard to tell what the weather is on Mauna Kea right now because the web cams are all covered in snow SkiHawaii,HRTHappy Makemake day Makemake was the last really bright KBO found Nine years ago today EasterBunny,HRTHey In hours the first two weeks of my free online solar system class go live SciSolSys Be there,HRTThe aftershocks clearly have plan think they are heading for the Ontario airport,HRTAnd there is instantly thread on my class discussion forum about whether Pluto should be planet have no one to blame but myself,HRTOK help out the seismic hazard folks Did you feel that one,HRTholy crap nice earthquake,HRTThat intro lecture can be found here Also you get to take poll on why my hair looks green,HRTIf youtempted to take my free online Solar System class but don know if it the right level for you check out the intro lecture,HRTFriday present to you my Science of the Solar System free online class is LIVE NOW days early SciSolSys,HRTOK everyone Can we now all step back and agree that these embargoes on scientific papers are irritating and stupid,HRTmy free online class starts on the Solar System starts Monday What else are you doing next week,HRTGreat discovery of new object in the same region as Sedna Why is this cool Read Sedna back story here,HRTThe seals are getting pretty excited about the outer solar system press releases today springbreak,HRTOhhh almost makes me feel bad about killing Pluto But honestly get over it,HRTAlso apropos nothing my pick for March Madness is ADHD followed closely by schizophrenia Though perhaps should have gone with OCD,HRTFor those asking the class is Science of the Solar System and you can sign up it free here SciSolSys,HRTthink this counts as the BICEP money shot,HRTcan get into the press site but the BICEP papers are now live,HRTNo chance to watch tonight as am here watching the cosmos instead,HRTCurrently observing the trojan asteroid Hektor Out of respect we will not be observing Achilles tonight,HRTHEY My free online class The Science of the Solar System starts in weeks Questions Ask me,HRTWhen was in high school me and my geeky friends would dissect every moment of Cosmos on Monday morning Whatyour kids doing tomorrow,HRTHey West coast It Comos time The Carl Sagan version is why an astronomer Your kids might say the same in yrs about this one,HRTSeems all scientists need to tweet opinion of Gravity Me think it great song but Alison Krauss should have sung one more verse,HRTcould and do watch this all night Saturn rising in the CFHT cloud cam Milky way sneeks in at the end,HRTThe sun is degrees below the horizon at Mauna Kea so the astronomers now come out to play Less wind tonight more trojans discovered,HRTMauna Kea Kohala Big Island Haleakala Maui Three volcanoes All in row Because PLATE TECTONCS,HRTSun is coming up here at Mauna Kea estimate that we discovered new Jupiter trojan asteroids last night Tomorrow maaawrrrr,HRTThis is an awesome analemma,HRTThe Subaru telescope is having some glitchess at the start of night Theyunplugging it and plugging it back in It really big plug,HRTHey Titan is cold Its atmosphere stinks You can even skate there Cause solid methane sinks,HRTFor Flying to Titan Sure would be great Sorry about plutonium,HRTlove to go fly there It sure would be nice To know which kind of salts whales drink Under the ice,HRTEuropa has salt Which kind don know Chlorides or sulfates All mixed up with snow,HRTWhy Europa Cause it cool yo,HRTNice to see so many signing up for my free online Science of the Solar System class Means gotta get recording,HRTOnline class starts March but you can go sign up RIGHT NOW For free And watch the video preview,HRTlove you Like love Pluto By the way No longer consider you an adult BadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRTOrcus and Vanth are tidally locked We could be the same If only you were more dissipative BadDwarfPlanetValentines OnlyMaybeTrue,HRTMy heart as full of love as Ceres is full of water Water in Ceres is still largely theoretical BadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRTQuauar is shiny With quite funny name If your name were more funny love you the same BadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRTEris is yellow With quite high albedo It got high mass Um unlike you BadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRTSedna is red Haumea is blue Well not really blue More like white BadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRTThe only book in existence signed my me and Clyde Tombaugh,HRTHere is the state of the union at my house seconds ago Rommel,HRTdidn watch the state of the union but can tell via Twitter that the union remains snarky,HRTve diagnosed the rattle in my Subaru engine It the acorns that the mice have stored for the winter,HRTsad that got no video of the man playing guitar between Tesla coils last night But it looked like this,HRTjust saw man playing electric guitar in chainmail suite getting zapped with giant Tesla coils So there that,HRTRemember just because the new report of steam coming from Ceres is published in Nature doesn necessarily mean it is wrong,HRTUp close the Endeavour looks little worse for the wear but it still an amazing see sight,HRTFirst up Canals on Mars How could you not start class with canals on Mars,HRTToday starting to record videos for my on line planetary science class Coming to computer near you in April on,HRTSometimes at sunset just sit and watch the nearly full moon rise outside my office window,HRTHere the tl dr version yes the Jupiter trojan asteroids and Kuiper belt objects have the same proportions of big vs med vs small objs,HRTWait is it actually legal for school not in Alabama to win the BCS Or are rare exceptions made for states bordering Alabama,HRTHappy th birthday to Eris the most massive dwarf planet known IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE true NotAsImpressiveAsItSounds,HRTOne last view of the Endeavour done in flowers,HRTnew icon the City of LA Rose Parade float leads with the Endeavour now hosted at the CA Science Center,HRTHappy th time the Earth has orbited the sun since an arbitrary time ago yay,HRTIf you think spherical things should be classified as planets Ceres is good Also go outsidelook at the much larger planet Moon,HRTCeres And its raw spectrum Cute little spherical asteroid no,HRTGanymede And it raw spectrum Welooking for compositional differences between the equatorpoles,HRTYou might be glad to know that we are done with Uranus for the evening ahem,HRTUranus rotates fast one of the storms is nearly off the limb already,HRTThe two bright dots on the faint disk are storms on Uranus with clouds high that sunlight reflects before being absorbed by methane,HRTIn the infrared Uranus is nearly invisible because of methane absorption but the faint rings still reflect sunlight,HRTReading on the current state of NASA It depressing to read even if you know it already,HRTKeck still closed the Europa eclipse we came to see is lost But we took out an Dobs and watched in real life Cause that how we roll,HRTWhoo hoo The winds are blowing so hard on Mauna Kea that the Keck telescope just blew sideways Um literally Closing for now,HRTThere is an asteroid named Mikebrown and today it makes its not very close closest approach of the year Merry Christmas from Mikebrown,HRTlocated the problem there man stuck in the engine,HRTSolstice My favorite day of the year my family biggest celebration First heading to the woods to find tree for tonight candles,HRTDear Science Sometimes the amount of stupid just realized that did cannot be expressed on family friendly feed,HRTStill my favorite moon landing video of all time,HRTMoon landing ok kinda love moon landings sorry That amazing Chang descent video,HRTHaving moon landing today makes me feel lot like kid again,HRTMy take on plumes on Europa awesome observations intriguing conclusions would love to see it more than once before believing,HRTOnly potential orbits to check before we have searched for every possible bright KBO in the sky My computer keeping me warm,HRTWhen faced with baffling data there is really only one clear choice Go home AndHaveAMartini,HRTAlso when it gets below in LA people say IT FREEZING outside so it is likely that water freezes at much higher temp around here,HRTve ton of work to do but can tear myself away from this NASA virtual town hall Like watching the last bit of shipwreck go under,HRTWow NASA is currently have Town Hall meeting and essentially telling planetary scientists to look for new jobs Wow,HRTSeriously good If youcurious about who is planet and who is not and why you should go read this now,HRTWanna see comet ISON Keep an eye on this live camera from the summit of Mauna Kea over the next minutes,HRTIn astronomy spectroscopy is where the real science lives But the hot off the telescope data aren so pretty,HRTWhoa MT An ISON tail image to rule all others is my favorite now Any takers,HRTNice piece in Nature News on the oddities of UX and what it might mean for dwarf planet formation,HRTIn about hours wegoing to observe comet ISON with the inch Palomar telesope Why Because we can that why,HRTfound this note snuck into the suitcase packed to go to Palomar Observatory,HRTSo this is just one tiny point in sea of turbulent data but my health insurance premium is dropping in First drop ever Hmmm,HRTlist possible dwarf planets probable The top includes MS about which we know nearly nothing Someone get on it,HRTDwarf planet fans have finally updated my dwarf planet page to include the latest size albedo measurements Look,HRTOK ok this was my pumpkin from last year But it better than this year so worthpost,HRTAlso Southern California whatever you do do not slow down on the freeways just because of rain Because then you know the rain wins,HRTThe mysterious sky falling liquid appears to be water Checked around the office the elders remember this phenomenon from the distant past,HRTFellow Californians liquid is currently FALLING FROM THE SKY No joke Can tell its precise composition Analyzing Will report back,HRTAlso Daddy Who are Oberon and Titania again Me two heavily crattered moons of Uranus with ice mean King and Queen of the Fairies,HRTenter Lilah me Lilah How now Daddy wither wander you Me Youreading Shakespeare without me Midsum Night Dream Oh puck,HRTFor those asking the MOOC starts on The Solar System for Scientists Senior undergrad level All welcome,HRTTonight was the celebration for th anniversary of the Feynman teaching prize And these were the cookies,HRThad not thought to check before but it turns out KBO UX is the largest known solid body in the solar system that would float,HRTToo late for meEuropa Stupid shutdown Weback We now return you to your space related posts,HRTIt great to see everything coming back online after the shutdown but the amount of pissed off still have is not going away anytime soon,HRTLilah and just finally finished Romeo and Juliet The ending is not how Taylor Swift promised,HRTHey since we should have guvment by tomorrow does that mean we can fly and observe Europa with SOFIA hint no too late sucka,HRTstill sad about missing Europa data on Thursday night because of the shutdown but this breaks my heart,HRTExcept of course SOFIA is sitting in hanger in
