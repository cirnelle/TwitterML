engineers are still hard at work,LRTYou can find nice picture took of Mars on the DLR website please note the image is CIVA Philae ESA,LRTOne of those reasons is that my cameras don point in the same direction So if OSIRIS can see something can,LRTdon take as many pictures as OSIRIS does aboard my mothership Rosetta There are several reasons for this,LRTwould like to clarify am not carrying nuclear or other weapons or Bruce Willis do have drill though,LRTam now just million km from the comet going to land on in and getting closer all the time now,LRTll do it first though Harpooning

thruster can also give me small push towards the comet during descent reducing the descent time PhilaeThursday,LRTThis is because the comet is so small its gravity is very weak don want to bounce off into space back after landing PhilaeThursday,LRTUnlike landing on planet where thrusters may be used to slow down lander my thruster will push me down ONTO the comet PhilaeThursday,LRTThe first of my subsystems alphabetically is the Active Descent System or ADS which has Nitrogen gas thruster PhilaeThursday,LRTof my subsystems were built using advanced technology from crashed alien spacecraft Yes even spacecraft enjoy aprilfools day,LRThave subsystems and am carrying experiment units The SS keep me alive but the expts are the reason was built PhilaeThursday,LRTYay being followed by one

questions now WSW TTE,LRTslept well and did not recollect any dreams Now sometimes dream of being in space though,LRTDo you dream differently in space from WSW TTE,LRTEvery astronaut wants to return stay for months to make it worth the cost and risk of launching without missing people on Earth,LRTYou spent days in space if you had the opportunity to return and stay longer would you WSW from,LRTand the river snakes darkly through it all WSW TTE,LRTWhat do you see the ESA Doing ten years from now from,LRTIf reliable and cost effective ESA will hire on commercial basis ESA and other European ventures are developing rockets of their own,LRTHow will europe compete with cheaper newer private rockets WSW TTE from,LRTIon drives are not capable of this yet but if you don need fast delivery and chemical engines assist it could work TTE,LRTCould an ion drive go from LEO to Mars for delivery of Cargo Like SMA WSW from,LRTMy advice to is to make the most of opportunities for looking out of the window WSW TTE,LRTWhat advice would you give to before he goes to the ISS WSW TTE,LRTloved feeling weightless the views of Earth and space and seeing the experiments work but most of all enjoyed the crew team spirit,LRTWhat was your favourite thing about living in space WSW TTE,LRTDo you think mankind should go to Mars WSW TTE,LRTFear is of the unknown My training had been good so there was no fear and claustrophobia was not an issue WSW TTE,LRTDid you ever feel scared or claustrophobic when you were on the Mir space station If so what did you do to cope,LRTHow did

spacecraft,LRTWhat activities were you involved with while you were in space WSW TTE,LRTWhat did you find was the most challenging part of your training WSW TTE,LRTdecided as soon as knew of the opportunity heard an advert for the job on my car radio on my way home from work in June,LRTWhen did you first decide to become an astronaut WSW TTE,LRTdid chemistry degree Required was degree in science engineering or medicine with practice at work Now you want PhD as well,LRTWhat academic qualifications did you do and which were required from WSW TTE,LRTMost food is inside packets or tubes so you don smell it but even so taste reduces Probably due to body fluid shift and mineral loss,LRTWhy does your sense of taste get worse in space from,LRTSolid state quantum processors exist though they don do much yet and there is big investment say years for something useful,LRTHow soon do you see electronics industry moving to quantum computing and beyond the electron WSW from,LRTIf leaving keep your contacts and be prepared for serious effort to get back up to speed But leaving opens the mind so it is also good,LRTDo you have any advice from your experience to support older women in tech Ie encourage to return not leave from,LRTIon propulsion is used for some spacecraft interplanetary and for satellite orientation It is unlikely to be useful for launches,LRTCan Full Body Ion Propulsion Work from WSW,LRTUsing technical equipment and applying science in factory is similar to what astronauts do in space though the views are better,LRTHow did you make the transition from

remember to use code Cosmic to unlock presale,LRTJust checking in from vacation to mention that my year oldare both loving the Wings of Fire fantasy book series by Tui Sutherland,LRTOK folks this impromptu and has been fun but it bedtime TTFN,LRTIt is not But we rarely know which simplified set of physical rules to apply Planets are easier than people,LRTSomething something Nice model don remember help,LRTPretty much If an atmosphere is collisional if you can knock one atmos molecule into another you ve got wind,LRTNot at the moment but Phobos is popular target andbet wesee missions planned in the future,LRTThere isn much yet but there will be soon from New Horizons For topo need overlapping photos or limb views,LRTSorry had to delete the mosaic tweet because of bonehead mistake in the credits Will reissue it shortly,LRTOne more raw frame has shown up from hi res Charon mosaic but it contains nothing prolly pointed at space,LRTMVIC images do not get raw release treatment They haven downlinked many anyway have PR released what they have,LRTBriefing over going to start working little but am waiting for raw image release to really get to work on my post,LRThave not called in to ask question find it awkward to listen to phone audio watch NASA TV simultaneously PlutoPlutoPluto,LRTOfficial raw image page makes it hard to do that but bulk downloader works with my version,LRTYes ve seen this great work which used screen cap from NASA TV because the full res version hasn been posted,LRTOf course We are an international society Join at,LRTToday Cassini is taking snapshots of Saturn small inner moons to monitor their orbits,LRTDoesn look likeget blog entry done today not all images from briefing are on web and no raw images to fill in withtired,LRTdidn get chance to ask when weekly raw pic release would start Was hoping for after press briefing but nope,LRTthat was fun even ran into Joe Palca on the way out,LRTAww miss my daughters,LRTAck it looks like the Charon image retweeted got un posted again Third time the charm hope,LRTthink that image wasn ready for prime time yet so unretweeted,LRTItbe in my blog post coming soon,LRTfinished with type type type now to switch to post post post,LRTThe original schedule had them kicking media out of this building at pm but now they re saying pm Tick tick tick type type type,LRTSame here,LRTBefore forget need to thank for defending my seat in the press briefing room so could run off to Skype to live,LRTBut for now it time to pack up and return to my hotel,LRTOkay think have been working too long and it is too late in the day for me to understand fields and particles science,LRTRalph McNutt is talking and and are not here to take notes so will have to serve,LRTBasically yes,LRTam having parallel processing problems in my brain so please just read streams,LRTtweets most of the good quotes first but once in while gotta tweet one faster to keep her on her toes,LRTThanks for the primer on atmospheric escape processes,LRTBriefing over,LRTStern was interrupted by Siri on somebody phone just now,LRTDoes anybody else think that those Charon chasms look little Miranda ish,LRTteam After Stern dissing of geology today you better put one of your geologists on panel soon vote Jeff Moore,LRTJim Green New Horizons is really the mission we wanted all along and we finally got it,LRTNow Randy Gladstone is telling us about atmosphere observations and are live tweeting,LRTRight now have to choose between writing blog entry about visiting before Pluto flyby and going back to visit people,LRTFaceTime is the greatest thing ever for traveling parents,LRTBecause of the lovely weather in Maryland think will be going through two shirts day Therefore,LRTHI,LRTBLARG made calendar mistake and now have to bail on speaking engagement agreed to long time ago,LRTHa also now hungry,LRTDear pre travel anxiety you re not helping me get ready for this trip Go away,LRTQuestion for New Horizons folks Fountain said NH command load would begin tomorrow EDT That Earth Received Time right,LRTGah got disconnected and missed min of the briefing,LRTFountain now explaining the anomaly taking noteswill tweet details in moment,LRTOops corrected link for the New Horizons briefing,LRTve been asked to blurb book The book is great but finding it super hard to write blurb that doesn sound stupid,LRTMy daughter wants to buy fantasy books with horses for her friend th birthday Any recommendations,LRTBecause there no obvious clue in the images as to where the barycenter is no landmark,LRTleave that as an exercise for the viewer Translation from academese ran out of time,LRTTorn between going to bed and playing with New Horizons images Okay maybe just couple pictures,LRTToday Cassini is studying the light curve and color of distant tiny moon Tarvos,LRTThey are and We tried it when they were and and they were not interested,LRTOH in the next room where my daughters are playing with their can go to sleep don know where my gun is,LRTOkay it after pm and haven even started work on finishing my Curiosity update post gosh darn it,LRTGlad you liked it,LRTCassini follows its crescent Titan observation with the first of series of Saturn storm watch observations over the next days,LRTThere goes the drogue LDSD,LRTGood burn LDSD,LRTOMG can believe they still have video from the ground what an awesome view LDSD,LRTGo LDSD,LRTHa,LRTve said it before andno doubt say it again Oh my god you guys Korra is so good,LRTItnever get old,LRTThank you,LRTShort exposure seconds means few or no stars visible moons smaller than Charon also too dim,LRTLOL was thinking exactly the same thing Or maybe Hyperion has something to hide on the other side,LRThaven been tweeting space today because the whole family is at AmherstReunion,LRTNobody on panel will be able to tell me what want to know which is nitty gritty details about camera capabilities ve emailed PIs,LRTActually all the way down,LRTCurrent status drinking port and downloading quantities of MRO CTXHiRISE data asonedoes,LRTBlergh messed up UT time conversion Deleted tweet relaunching,LRTLots of space stuff happening today but am spending the morning watching one of my kids get cavities filled poor kid She doing fine,LRTWeek daily images now being released by Enjoy,LRTLooks like will indeed be in dental chair as we lose contact with for the last time,LRTJust made hotel reservation in Maryland in July to be in the middle of the action when encounters Pluto,LRTCassini is beginning its Rev with couple weeks of storm watch observations of Saturn,LRTDownloaded bunch of newly public Cassini data yesterday but not having much luck processing it into cool pics,LRTUp at dark early for quick day trip to Arizona State University for workshop on planetary imaging,LRTcosign with enthusiasm,LRTMy task for this afternoon prepare talk explaining why amateur space image processors are awesomepros should take advantage of them,LRTOh man so many ideas for blog posts inspired by stuff in my email inbox this morning but nearly all would take days to write,LRTWatching really great show on mathematics featuring,LRTProud definitely proud And of course only you know where all the hidden bases are,LRTlove how Hal Weaver always has big smile for the audience,LRTWas just interviewed by high school student that was fun,LRTNew Horizons briefing doubleheader is over Thanks for putting up with my deluge of

events are in frequencypossibly severity,LRTCatch up on today PLOS Science Wed AMA here,LRTAMA Are mass die offs actually getting worse more frequent or larger in scale in recent decades years,LRTAMA In this case the invertebrates died very rapidlytheir death wouldn have been great warning system,LRTAMA What long term effects will this have on the surrounding ecosystems Is the problem improving stable or worsening,LRTAMA Quite few marine scientists work shipping industry to harmful practicessustainable ones,LRTAMA How do people in marineecology view the shipping industryits impact on ocean habitats,LRTAMA Interestingly no algae grew where we lost massive urchin populations,LRTAMA It not the primary cause of the die off but more research is needed to learn the effects of the warm blob,LRTAMA Is higher temps in the Pacific Ocean the primary cause of the die offs,LRTAMA Urchins are known to go through boom and bust cycles but this is the largest die off of this species,LRTAMA There are very effective ways to coastal pollution that algal blooms but some may still occur,LRTAMA Our group didn detect any effects on fish at all,LRTAMA How will this die off affect consumable fish What about shellfish,LRTAMA To me the concern is that we preserve the amazing biodiversity of the earth,LRTAMA It important to note we have no guarantee that US west coast native oysters will be fine That still an area of ongoing research,LRTAMA IMO fixing these probs requires lot of public outcryconsistent involvement by citizens,LRTAMA What can do to help prevent the extinction of these sea species along the Pacific coast,LRTAMA by Algal growth models could be really useful avenue for future research,LRTAMA There are more cases of low invertebrate kills than toxicity but in this case oxygen isn the cause,LRTAMA by agree it unlikely the event we describe is directly related to the sea star wasting disease,LRTDon miss new ecology post on from ESA,LRTPlease do,LRTPLOS Weds goes live in mins Ask anything abt ecologymarine invertebrate die off,LRTAMA Do these algal blooms kill all sea lifedoes the algal blooms in prt of the ecosystem create cascade,LRTThx for helping us spread the word abt today PLOS Science Weds ecology ESA,LRTAMA If harmful human practices stopped would most fish pops to good levels quickly or would it take long time,LRTAMA Do any marine animals thrive under today conditions caused by humans or is everything in the ocean doomed,LRTAMA Is there any data on the pre collapse genetic diversity of the effected populations ecology,LRTAMA Is there anything we can actually do to reverse this Not just limit the harm but actively turn this back,LRTAMA Are these mass marine die offs coral reefs getting more frequent or larger in scale in recent yrs,LRTAMA How much has the frequency of harmful algal bloom changed since the start of the industrial age,LRTAMA Could the die offs be related to the low levels of dissolved oxygen that follow large algal blooms,LRTAMA the only immediate thing both these areas seem to have in common is higher sea temperature anomalies,LRTEcologyclimate authors papers

of Practice is most symbolic effort to SSA health worker retention but is nonbindingineffective,LRTAMA What are some ways govts in SSA are incentivizing physicians to practice med in their countries of origin,LRTAMA Yes by selecting students from rural areasnurturing their career primary care many return home to work,LRTAMA Would picking students stronger connections to homearen necessarily looking for the biggest paycheck help this problem,LRTAMA The nations that have done better to keep their professionals had improved infrastructures better health staffingquality control,LRTAMA Yes MEPI CONSAMS SACORE partnerships like the universities partnering Rwanda,LRTAMA Are there efforts to strengthen med programs in SSA to incentivize potential drs to staycomplete their medical training at home,LRTAMA The US doesn train enough physicians to meet its needshas always relied on migration from abroad,LRTAMA Are there really lots of open positions in the US or is this just an attempt by corporations to drive wages,LRTAMA Stopping the migration of skilled health workers from SSA may not be possible but it is definitely feasible,LRTAMA look at the codedon see how it could have helped what going to stop someone qualified from seeking higher pay abroad,LRTAMA Incentivizing early career physicians to stay and practice in SSA should be the focus,LRTAMA What can be done by govts on both sides to encourage SSA physicians to practice in their home countries,LRTLIVE PLOS Science Wed how migration of African health workers impacts global health MT,LRTAMA Most SSA migrant physicians practicing in the US were recruited here as residents then as licensed physicians,LRTAMA When you say recruited do you mean US companies hospitals are actively depriving SSA of medical

the entire genomes or plasmids of these evolved strains syntheticbiology,LRTAMA Do you have the sequence of the entire genome including plasmids of each colony strain you produce,LRTAMA Optimal does not nec mean maximal goal is to find the best variant for production of the metabolite,LRTAMA The best combination was no chaperone low plasmid copy number strong promter strong RBS,LRTAMA What was the mechanism that the bacteria used to increase fitness syntheticbiology,LRTAMA would say that genetic engineering was misnomer when it was first described in the,LRTAMA What

candidates is Transit Timing Variation this tells us if there are multiple planets,LRTThe precise measurements RV can provide allow us to be sure that we are looking at planets and not something else,LRTWhy so many candidates waiting to be confirmed We have to be sure before planet makes the cut,LRTplanet highly eccentric orbit might pass in and out of the hab zone good time to be water

exoplanet It one of two super Earth size planets that orbit the star,LRTOk back and the planet news has piled up For starters cross WASP off the exoplanet list looks like it actually binary star,LRTWild week for exoplanets first there was the planet train wreck discovered by Spitzer,LRTIn this case is roasting hot Jupiter with day orbit and is portly xJupiter mass planet with super eccentric orbit,LRTHAT and have people pretty excited it the first time multi planet system with one transiting planet has been discovered,LRTAnother new one HD is little bit smaller Jup masses and has pretty eccentric egg shaped orbit around its star,LRTNew planets HD is whopping Jupiter mass planet with year about days longer than Earth Massive,LRTInterviewed Greg Laughlin about planet that might serve as an extra gas tank thatreignite its star it the top story on PlanetQuest,LRTAnybody checked out Greg Laughlin blog at oklo org It dope well written cool photos and lots of stuff to ponder,LRTAlso had some folks announce that they observed the phases of an exoplanet as it orbited in front of and then behind its host star whoa,LRTPlanetQuest isn dead We ve had few new planet additions and some interesting finds like an exoplanet in Andromeda maybe,LRTIt been quiet lately but here some big news astronomers find planets using astrometry for the first time way cool,LRTProps to everyone who came to the JPL Open House Esp the RoboDome line survivors little video from inside the dome,LRTFun fact HAT transit was also detected by an amateur astronomer in Portugal lots of people getting in on the planet hunt,LRTNew planet HAT is sub Saturn size planet orbiting in scorching day orbit,LRTIf you re in SoCal this weekend come check out the free JPL open house See cool stuff talk to scientists visit the legendary ROBODOME,LRTThat not all HD is gas giant planet with an eccentric orbit that takes it as close as Mercury to our sun and farther than Mars,LRTReply The waterworld theory is based on its orbit and models that predict lots of ice water on its surface just guess for now,LRTSo to sum up Gliese Kamino maybe Gliese Mustafar maybe Confused handy reference,LRTThe same team has also found that sister planet Gliese may actually be in its star habitable zone and could be an ocean planet,LRTThis just in Gliese is just the size of the Earth and is the smallest exoplanet yet discovered It could possibly terrestrial,LRTKepler first light images are up WOOT Check em out Let hope plenty of Earths are hiding in that starfield,LRTKepler will start collecting scientific data in few weeks so far so good,LRTThe Kepler dust cover was ejected successfully Scientists now know what kind of background noise to subtract from the science data,LRTOK scratch that last post the dust cover will be ejected in about an hour at the earliest sorry for the confusion,LRTKepler dust cover is scheduled to be ejected in about an hour at the latest,LRTGet stoked for hours of Astronomy Some cool stuff like Kepler and Spitzer webcasts or the chance get to control remote telescope,LRTThe other new planet is also in constellation Draco HD is hefty Jupiter size gas giant with an day orbit,LRTWell it been pretty quiet lately but finally we have some new planets Dra is gas giant orbiting sun size star at about AU,LRTKepler has launched Right on Everything seems to be going well so far nearly minutes into the flight,LRTThis planet was teased out of previously existing radial velocity data for HD using Bayesian analysis,LRTGas giant HD is little smaller than Jupiter with pretty eccentric orbit that averages about AU from its host star,LRTPlanet Alert Not much info on CoRoT Exo yet but it appears to be Hot Jupiter type with very close day orbit around its star,LRTInterestingly they have mean motion resonance meaning that over the same amount of time one planet makes orbits the other,LRTCouple new planets announced today HD and are gas giants that orbit at about and AU respectively eccentric orbits too,LRTDespite what you may have read the new planet is NOT confirmed to be the smallest in mass discovered it about times Earth mass,LRTHot new planet COROT Exo is the first transiting super Earth and maybe the first terrestrial planet found It about Earth size,LRTNew Super Earth discovered HD is about the size of Earth but with tiny day orbit around its star Bring the sunblock,LRTScientists using Spitzer have just seen an exoplanet with wild orbit heat up over in just over six hours Deets,LRTQuestions about exoplanets Bring em on,LRTScientists estimate the size of MOA BLG Lb to be about Earth masses still pretty small but not quite as much as was reported,LRTHeads up the Earth size planet reported yesterday was false alarm some confusion between couple of reports,LRTKepler going to watch the sky for few years looking for transiting exoplanets and letting us know just how many Earths might be nearby,LRTJust days until the launch of the Kepler mission get excited We ve got countdown and mission info at planetquest jpl nasa gov,LRTAnd the planet train keeps on rolling HD is about Jup size and has year almost as long as ours at days,LRTFirst new planet of HAT is almost Jup size with toasty day orbit located in the Cygnus constellation,LRTHD on the other hand is just over half Jupiter mass and takes just about Earth years to make its orbit we re up to now,LRTNew planets for the weekend HD is about Jup mass and take about Earth years to orbit its star,LRTOGLE TR is an even bigger closer roaster Jup size with an even tighter day orbit it no place to spend the holidays,LRTNew planets HAT is hot Jupiter type planet that about Jup size and has quick day orbit time another roaster,LRTPlanet portraits keep rolling in French astronomers managed to snap pic of planet orbiting the bright star beta Pic,LRTIts sister planet HD is bit bigger Jup size and orbits farther away AU albeit with pretty eccentric orbit,LRTAnd the planet train doesn stop HD is about the size of Jup and snuggles right up to its host star with an day orbit,LRTSo we re up to planets discovered but more importantly we finally have visible light images of exoplanets Christmas comes early,LRTAnd finally HR orbits at AU and sits about AU from its star Both HD and Fomalhaut are visible from Earth stars only,LRTHR is another big ol gas giant Jup size orbiting its star at distance of AU That makes for day long year,LRTOne of the trio of planets that was imaged HR is about Jupiter size and orbits hefty AU from its host also blue star,LRTOne of the imaged planets Fomalhaut is no bigger than Jupiter size It orbits about AU from its host young blue star,LRTHere another link with better picture of the three planets discovered from the ground,LRTAnd it doesn stop there Scientists also managed to snap pics of more from the GROUND wow Check it out,LRTHubble has snapped one of the first pictures of an exoplanet Take look here,LRTBIG exoplanet news coming up later today Stay tuned,LRTSo now we re up to planets These latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky using the radial velocity method,LRTNow this is big one HD is Jupiter size and has really odd eccentric orbit Planet or brown dwarf It not clear yet,LRTHD is Jupiter mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was Earth orbits from our Sun,LRTCorrection to the last post planet name is HD Yet another poetic exoplanet moniker,LRTHalloween planets HD is gas giant about the size of Jupiter with an orbit about as far out from its star as Mars is,LRTThat makes new planets discovered and brings our planet count to Get the fine details on these cool new worlds at,LRTHD is gas giant with super eccentric orbit if it orbited our sun it would swing from closer than Mercury to farther than Mars,LRTHD is massive planet the size of Jupiter It has very eccentric orbit that takes it days to complete,LRTHD is the size of Jupiter with an orbit of days around star just hotter than our sun about as long as Mars year,LRTBD is big ol Jupiter size planet with pretty eccentric day orbit around its small star,LRTHD is also in the constellation Scorpio is the size of Jupiter and is bit further from its star than Earth is at AU,LRTLots of new planets to announce HD is almost the size of Jupiter and orbits about half an AU from sunlike star,LRTLupus TR is back on the list new evidence shows it planet This is Jupiter size world that only AU from its star Hot,LRTLooks like Lupus TR might actually be part of multiple star and not actually planet so we re dropping it from the count for now,LRTWeird COROT exo is the size of Jupiter but its mass Scientists aren yet sure just what it actually is Link,LRTLooks like the HAT and WASP teams found the same planet at the same time So now it called HAT WASP and the count is back to,LRTThis actually just refers to extrasolar planets not in our own solar system good question,LRTFor those keeping score this brings us up to planets discovered and multi planet solar systems so far it busy neighborhood,LRTAnd HD is more than the size of Jupiter and orbits its star about as far away as Mars is from our sun,LRTLooks like today triple play for new planets HD is just about the size of Jupiter and orbits at abou AU from its star,LRTNew planet added today CT Cha crams Jup masses into planet just times as big and orbiting AU possibly brown dwarf,LRTMOA BLG was discovered using gravitational lensing an exotic way to hunt for planets using light bent by the gravity from stars,LRTNew planet for Talk Like Pirate Day Not much info yet about MOA BLG it about the size of Jupiter and AU from its star,LRTIt been busy week for planet hunters new gas giants announced and one retracted for total count of exoplanets discovered,LRTNASA has announced the Carl Sagan Fellowships in Exoplanet Exploration The stipend will be year to selected postdocs,LRTRemember to see the stats for any of these planets just visit and type in the name of the planet,LRTTW Hydrae has been dropped from the atlas due to findings that it might have been detection of stellar spots instead,LRTAnd one more HD which is about the size of Jupiter AU from its star which is just about Sun size Big planet,LRTHD was also announced it times the size of Jupiter and orbits about AU from its star which is the size of the sun,LRTAt long last we have some new planet updates GJ is about half the size of Jupiter and orbits AU from its tiny host star,LRTNew story on planetquest jpl nasa gov Backyard planet hunting Amateur astronomers join the exoplanet

going to have to be our lodestar WCSJ,LRTmentions the rise of science blogging says it good despite issues Notes they need to meet journalistic values WCSJ,LRTBest sites are enduring funders don influence the journalists We need those firewall policies WCSJ,LRTalso references and says older groups like becoming more sure footed WCSJ,LRTSomething similar may be happening at now building capacity to do deep work WCSJ,LRTSome formerly cut rate places are now raising their game doing good journalism says referring to WCSJ,LRTThere at least three hopeful responses underway None are ideal But they giving us good digital journalism WCSJ,LRTWe need to show the public why free press matter WCSJ,LRTrd problem with audience atomization is it creates opportunities for mischief by special interest groups WCSJ,LRTCross cultural conversations are being stifled by this atomization of interest WCSJ,LRTBut even as we are converging in multimedia tools we are diverging in our content Easy to build information bubble WCSJ,LRTIt time when they can tell more transparent vivid contextual stories WCSJ,LRTEmploying tools of media with narrative skills these multimedia journalists can do amazing work WCSJ,LRTMy students will learn to shoot and edit video audio basic coding even tweeting They will do lot of writing WCSJ,LRTIncreasingly think the same media convergence will be occurring all over the world WCSJ,LRTIt all sounds pretty grim and yet there are reasons not to lose hope WCSJ,LRTAt time when the US press is economically weak we are also losing the access we need Most voters don seem upset WCSJ,LRTMany people don embrace the strong values of free journalism WCSJ,LRTIt not so bad in places like Asia but how long will it last WCSJ,LRTMany of us have come to realize the general public doesn care much about our problems WCSJ,LRTWe now know there is nothing inevitable about transition to elective govt or about free journalism WCSJ,LRTThe emergence of the Internet only made us more confident we thought we knew what tank man wanted WCSJ,LRTthink for many years there was smug triumphalism in US media that of course people wanted to be like us WCSJ,LRTremembers the incident at Tiananmen Square We know about it because there were journalists there WCSJ,LRTnotes that he knows the US best and apologizes for any bias in the talk WCSJ,LRTwants to step back and look at the big picture How did we get here Where are we going WCSJ,LRTNow hearing talk at WCSJ Squee Somedayget brave enough to introduce

WCSJ,LRTShow people what you are doing as you do it with Instagram etc get people excited before story comes out WCSJ,LRTsays you need to be yourself everyone else is already taken Develop relationships with readers via social media WCSJ,LRTSometimes words aren enough comics can be powerful media says WCSJ,LRTdid piece on einsteins visit to Argentina to promote it he tweeted like he was at the visit in WCSJ,LRTis plugging the science and entertainment exchange connecting scientists with Hollywood WCSJ,LRTHis favorite bridge between science and fiction is space odyssey WCSJ,LRTYou can use good and bad examples in movies to explain science WCSJ,LRThas strategies using fiction to capture attention and spark imagination WCSJ,LRTsays you have to punch through the pseudoscience How do you get through the noise WCSJ have to be interesting,LRTtalks about blending science and sci fi Like this WCSJ,LRTNow on strategies for digital storytelling WCSJ,LRTMarie tells the story of one camera crew that tried to manufacture fight between scientists Yikes WCSJ,LRTHighlight the human element to help viewers feel their motivations But again it rigor Marie says WCSJ,LRTMany scientists do much better when they think the camera is off Marie says Basic questions help too WCSJ,LRTHow do you find interviewees who are both knowledgable and charismatic Marie says pretty rare Knowledgeability is mandatory WCSJ,LRTWe only have to find what is sexy in science It not about forcing sexy on top of science says Marie WCSJ,LRTMarie says what you decide not to tell if just as important as what you decide to tell Do pruning for the relevant information WCSJ,LRTBut entertainment without rigor is even worse WCSJ how do you build narrative for audience with limited attention span,LRTNOW Marie Pier Elie Notes that rigor without any entertainment is no good in TV WCSJ,LRTSo Emilie wrote about the issues why the observatory was too small Again scientists were angry too much human factor WCSJ,LRTEmilie says she was writing about cosmic rays and an observatory Turns out observatory was too small WCSJ,LRTOh sorry Current comments are from Emilie Martin their name plaques are mixed up WCSJ,LRTScientist complained there was too much human factor and not enough science WCSJ,LRTShe ended up writing about how people lived at the research station who they were etc WCSJ the scientist hated it,LRTMarie Piere Elie says she went to see scientists finding auroras but had no luck with the science WCSJ,LRTNow in entertainment and rigor can they coexist WCSJ,LRTLunch at WCSJ Lovely presentation,LRTlooks to the background for previous studies on the topic and looks up those people WCSJ,LRTDon just rely on study authors Find outside comment That doesn always mean disagreement WCSJ,LRTAsk about alternative was drug compared to placebo or to another drug Ask for people who might disagree van Maaren WCSJ,LRTVan Maaren says it not just dollars to follow but career People are thinking of tenure and faculty positions WCSJ,LRTWe get excited about positive results but every drug has side effects WCSJ,LRTWhen it comes to numbers show don tell says van Maaren Most ppl don know percentages WCSJ,LRTYour editor may say hey want this story It ok to look for other alternative angles Like teen author WCSJ,LRTWho will benefit from these findings Do lot of people have this disease Keep disease mongering in mind WCSJ,LRTAsk were you going on fishing expedition Hunting around to find significant things WCSJ,LRTAsk if this was what they planned to test and whether the difference is clinically interesting What does it mean WCSJ,LRTAsk awkward questions get at the nuances We re those primary endpoints Some studies move goalposts WCSJ,LRTThen meta analyses of studies But even here lots of things can go wrong Tough to find studies equal enough to pull together WCSJ,LRTWhat kind of study was it Observational Controlled trial WCSJ,LRTSmart questions to ask is it in humans What the sample size Is there power calculation find power calcs are pretty rare WCSJ,LRTVan Maanen recommends getting into uni library for paper access But know this can be tough call for many WCSJ,LRTWe ve all gotten used to not trusting corp press releases academic ones have issues too WCSJ,LRTof the time you can find the limitations listed in the paper Some journals put it right in the abstract WCSJ,LRTIf you ask people about doing something healthy take their answer and cut it in half on human self report WCSJ,LRTNow in session on reading and reporting medical studies without being fooled With WCSJ,LRTAnother trap was Ebola was far away until it wasn And it wasn about the people in west Africa WCSJ,LRTBut in terms of timing and focus for ebola coverage Not so great Alarm didn grow Til late WCSJ,LRTDid you all do good job covering ebola on balance yes leveraged fear in responsible way WCSJ,LRTNow Oliver Yun from MSF to talk about ebola WCSJ,LRTwas very worried about infection had no insurance WCSJ,LRTIn June there wasn really western interest in ebola WCSJ,LRThas video of an ebola burial There was no dignity WCSJ,LRTUmaru says on the way home to Sierra Leone he going to be quarantined for two weeks for MERS think hes joking hope WCSJ,LRTDidn anticipate how difficult coming home would be Friends and coworkers don want to see you Ouch WCSJ,LRTsays life did continue normally People weren running around screaming WCSJ,LRTthings swung the pendulum the outbreak got worse and public health in Canada sent scientists Local bit helped WCSJ,LRTWorried about being strain on the resources about being the group to bring ebola back to Canada WCSJ,LRTsays tough to get to Africa for ebola trying to get the budget was tough and fear was factor WCSJ,LRTsniff no tea or coffee before session still none Didn get breakfast and now paying the price WCSJ,LRTNeed to be extremely rigorous with everything it not always going to be wrong but youknow if problematic WCSJ,LRTnow talking about the hype from unis in press releases She teaches her students to check everything WCSJ,LRTJournalists get too close to their sources we need to step back bit and think about what we re doing WCSJ,LRTIf we were doing journalism that mattered someone would be paying for it WCSJ,LRTWants to bring back muckrakers place for sci journos to deliver stories about what really going on WCSJ,LRTThat explosion of science pages was wonder of science moment but because easily expendable WCSJ,LRTsays yes at the end of the day you do need to eat and that ok need to be very transparent WCSJ,LRTQuestion as newspaper sections close people move to being PIOs what do you think of this WCSJ,LRTagrees it rough they have an investigative bureau in their uni By raising they fund journalists WCSJ,LRTNow questions Sci journos are being let go how do we fund the journalism you want to see WCSJ,LRTasked Craig Venter about whether there was misconduct in his lab He said sci is very pure But it not really WCSJ,LRTThen there the forensic skills we need social media data journalism There are great stories there WCSJ,LRTnow asking how much money we are following There may not be anything wrong but we should be able to see WCSJ,LRTThen there the watchdog role who is scrutinizing the way the govt spends money WCSJ,LRTnow covering fraud and misconduct and statistics says we don know how deep the iceberg is WCSJ,LRTSo peer review can be problematic when pressed for time and not able to do it properly WCSJ,LRTWho giving me the quality control had to had to work it out WCSJ on learning how to peer review,LRTwas torn wanted to do it properly and that takes time WCSJ,LRTAmid her questioning got her first peer review opportunity She was horrified that they wanted it in days WCSJ,LRTsays where the accountability There no transparency WCSJ,LRTNow talking about the stem cell debacle asked for the peer review of the paper WCSJ couldn get it,LRTWe know these problem with replication if the foundations are shaky the results aren solid WCSJ,LRTAs result of the pressure science is under its trying to increase boundaries communicate more WCSJ,LRTnow talking about boundary theory When there are pressures sci needs to hold boundaries by communicating WCSJ,LRTnow taking about science media center in the uk which controls access to science info WCSJ,LRTPpl say if you are nothing but watchdog there not enough to write about says we need to think differently WCSJ,LRTIt about the ideology of being journalists and the tensions we feel in trying to be everything WCSJ,LRTgroup is forming in Europe to try and reflect what is happening in science journalism WCSJ,LRTHow can we know who we are if we don discuss it It difficult to push under the table idea of who we are WCSJ,LRTSo say science journalists are acting as modest witnesses as well but Donna Harraway says we have no right WCSJ,LRTThe idea of modest witness has been backbone of the royal society idea of the scientist as modest witness WCSJ,LRTquotes about approaching things from many angles WCSJ,LRTan important question is what is journalism supposed to be or do WCSJ,LRTis comparing science journalism to hamlet specifically hamlets ghost WCSJ,LRTAudience members says most journos are freelancers not enough scandals to make living WCSJ,LRTAudience members says focusing too much on scandals will lead to that being only thing covered More interesting things happen WCSJ,LRTOnly by writing about fraud can we effect policy change WCSJ,LRTscientist says we do disservice when we discredit scientists in their eyes it will be bad when we need science WCSJ,LRTFinal question should sci journalists work harder to expose frauds and scandals WCSJ,LRTAudience says it should be more society Science is important to society So we need that WCSJ,LRTNext question should economy and policy be bigger part of science stories WCSJ,LRTMartin says we aren just about fraud and scandals we need to educate and communicate as well WCSJ,LRTAudience member says lead with the facts He doesn need human angle other people have that WCSJ,LRTThe right story is one that does both inform and talk about responding so this is about angles WCSJ,LRTviruses biology isn news How korea responds is news WCSJ,LRTSays if you are telling people whether or not to be scared you may feed into hype WCSJ,LRTIf you are talking about how the govt responds it tells you lot about the virus itself Response shows how virus behaves WCSJ,LRTMark says he write about biology when he in NYC but here he on the ground He can interview people MERS WCSJ,LRTRebuttal If you just talk about the way korea responded to MERS you are journo if you talk about bio you re sci journo WCSJ,LRTOthers says they want to know about the virus first and should they be scared WCSJ,LRTAnother says it the way you present the story You use people reaction to go into what the virus is WCSJ,LRTMartin says she wants to know the basics before she wants to know the social implications WCSJ,LRTThe next question is my MERS story tomorrow would be mostly on WCSJ,LRTNow with the Internet things have changed Our stories are interesting and we can count how many people care WCSJ,LRTMartin says sci not well understood lots of times journos call her as source We are in bubble It why we need to educate WCSJ,LRTOn to the next question do science journalists feel disrespected by other journalists WCSJ,LRTAudience member says if it better journalism you re arguing for convinced But what are you arguing for WCSJ,LRTWhere is the critical deficit Resources to practice journalism WCSJ,LRTFagin says what we need to reinforce is the journalism Says unis etc have their own ways to disseminate info WCSJ,LRTDan Fagin says if concerned about illiteracy you re not paying attention to soc sci research have to connect with ppl lives WCSJ,LRTOooh now we are asking about semantics What is journalism and what is science WCSJ,LRTSays with limited amount of resources they need the facts not an angle that make scientists look like bad guys WCSJ,LRTsci says remember you re not taking about scientists making money itYou want to be known for good work WCSJ,LRTRebuttal scientists are often arrogant so there needs to be journalist bridge Have to understand before you can dig dirt WCSJ,LRTSays we need more journalism to keep our hamburgers alive WCSJ,LRTAudience member says young science journalists lack ability to pitch with structure Need more journalism WCSJ,LRTSays he dislikes the use of lay people and says it condescending WCSJ,LRTWhen there new planet do we need to spend lots of time talking about where the money comes from WCSJ,LRTJack is calling for balance Martin agrees When there is something to dig up dig it up WCSJ,LRTJacks rebuttal we need education but we also need to be watchdogs Says we need to investigate agendas WCSJ,LRTOooh now we are going to debate this like the House of Commons No applause but hear hear and boo allowed WCSJ,LRTMartin says if you focus too much on fraud you may diminish interest in science Nothing but fraud lame sci section WCSJ,LRTMartin says in the current crisis is it feasible for many writers to go deep into every story WCSJ,LRTIf want to focus on policy makers we may focus more on money and fraud but when we write for general public it may be different WCSJ,LRTBut is it so bad to embrace the role of educators we fill two roles instead of one journalism and education WCSJ,LRTChallenge the background are scientists spending money in the most useful ways More questioning of money and power and impact WCSJ,LRTJack now references Bohannons chocolate sting and other questionable studies covered in general press WCSJ,LRTIn the changing journalism landscape do we need to get away from straight and more into journalism Andrew Jack explains more WCSJ,LRTNow at session does science journalism need more journalism and less science WCSJ,LRTStill feeling aftershocks He emphasized the role of media in reconstruction WCSJ he says we rise again,LRTHis group set up their newsroom under tent because they couldn go in the building WCSJ family members also with them,LRTHe managed to write the news and hit an pm deadline Estimated killed injured million houses damaged WCSJ,LRTHe walked to the office It was dangerous but we had deadline for tomorrow The building was cracked Most houses cracked WCSJ,LRTWorries that masks on symptomatic people only will cause stigma So masks yes or no Possibly yes MERS WCSJ,LRTpersonally face masks If you have symptoms you should wear mask we don know if that common cold or MERS WCSJ,LRTpeople are wearing face masks and closing schools should we tell people these things don work MERS WCSJ,LRTwith MERS we don have reports of environmental contamination as with SARS WCSJ,LRThow did the index patient get infected And how might the infection spread beyond if patient wasn incubated MERS WCSJ,LRTmedian age is similar to Middle East cases years old for MERS SARS is about years younger Comorbidity WCSJ,LRTpatient profile what is interaction with MERS and other conditions WCSJ,LRTConsidering things like antiretrovirals for treatment of MERS plasma therapy has not been proven WCSJ,LRTthe patient went to two hospitals before arriving at the final one where history was finally taken with travel MERS WCSJ,LRTno intubation of index patient it nebulizer use MERS WCSJ,LRTwas the index patient incubated Reason for spread Also reports that Dr warned ppl warning not acted on MERS WCSJ,LRTare there SOPs for hospitals in Korea yes but need to pay more attention only compliance for hand washing MERS WCSJ,LRTHospitals should keep an eye out for patients in crowded rooms and ERs many people don follow procedure MERS WCSJ,LRTLee Jong Hong also notes that to attack MERS of the RNA is focused on replication on everything else WCSJ,LRTAutopsy or necropsy What the difference This week scientists say,LRTDoesn work for poison does work for alcohol WCSJ also morphine cocaine other addictive drugs,LRTArsenic also in the idea you could get used to poison all the way back to Mithridates we ve dumped that theory WCSJ,LRTSorry guys trying to live

of Pluto,HRTkm pixel on incredibly thin crescents the opposite phase view of these,HRTWhile wait for pictures spending time making another model since gave first one away,HRTNew Horizons Awaiting the data In which explain what going on with raw image releases,HRTToday Cassini is taking snapshots of Saturn small inner moons to monitor their orbits,HRTlt amazing how often turn blog post into an excuse to dig through for Voyager data,HRTPlanetary exploration always does that that why into it,HRTEach mission has its own website and they do great job explaining basic whys and hows of their missions,HRTStern We are moving to weekly releases of raw image data,HRTOMG Pluto plains look like arctic polygonal terrain,HRTBolden We have visited every planet if you want to get technical we have visited every planet and dwarf lt someone needs to tell him,HRTIn the meantime will be on at ET along with Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman,HRTPeople if tweet contains link and you have

place of the traditional phone call these days,HRTAtmospheric science result,HRTCathy Olkin From the ground we knew there were lot of different colors on Pluto but we never imagined anything like this,HRTHere is the MVIC color data hope pics will make it online soon Charon pole is red,HRTThe not planets all those round worlds we ve visited to scale,HRTAs always there an XKCD for that,HRTthink that the most dangerous possible thing to say about Pluto flyby that with it we re somehow done with the solar system We re not,HRTOh this don agree with How about the whole rest of the Kuiper belt Eris Makemake Haumea Sedna Orcus,HRTBonnie Buratti We have been monitoring from Earth what we now know is the heart on Pluto for years,HRTBagenal Pluto looked remarkably like Mars Much better than Mars though,HRTFran Bagenal says it unlikely New Horizons will reach interstellar space it going slower than Voyagers,HRTJust had an opportunity to congratulate Marc Buie on the quality of his pre New Horizons Hubble maps of Pluto,HRTRosetta looked at Pluto too,HRTNew Horizons best look at Pluto before close approach,HRTBowman We were seconds early Stern Our nav predicts

my eye these pictures show younger surface on Pluto and much older and more battered surface on Charon PlutoFlyby,HRTGrunsfeld to Bowman What is the actual data rate think it lower than Bowman Yeah we wish it was PlutoFlyby,HRTasked if the new image showed evidence of hazes or clouds Stern replied he looked and hadn seen those or plumes yet,HRTXKCD What if What if New Horizons hit my car,HRTAs sitting in front row lot of photographers are shooting over my laptop with Pluto image on it to desk SternBowman,HRTThere is lot of applause happening but it feels premature until we hear from New Horizons again,HRTSince it FAQ It will be hours until we hear from New Horizons because spacecraft is too busy scienceing to talk to us right now,HRTPress briefing coming up momentarily But still hours until we find out whether New Horizons survived flyby or not,HRTClosest approach PlutoFlyby,HRTThey are playing The Final Countdown,HRTThis is happening outside the press room and off

Pluto encounter science results Pluto diameter composition atmosphere,HRTStern These first compositional measurements show us that the polar regions are compositionally very different from the dark regions,HRTStern People love turning little dots little points of light into planets and writing new textbooks from scratch,HRTGrunsfeld Pluto is capstone of our solar system exploration and also it opening up new realm,HRTStern explains color data is much more expensive in terms of bits to get it to the ground which is why more LORRI pics have come down,HRTCathy Olkin promises new color images tomorrow,HRTStern New Horizons cruise is not record Rosetta set record But Rosetta had many flybys so didn seem like interminable road trip,HRTStern We tested techniques we used to determine Pluto diameter on Charon and got the right answer radius km,HRTunderstand you have to put miles on graphics for Americans but for love of Pete why can you also put metric measurements,HRTStern We detected escaping nitrogen before expected Either escaping faster than we thought or mechanism is different than thought,HRTStern Pluto radius is km It settles the debate about the largest object in the

happened right now too,HRTOur drought magic trick Over the past yrs we slowly replaced grass with native planets Which look better Go us notactuallystinky,HRTAnd of course years ago Eris was Xena Makemake was Easterbunny Haumea was Santa It took me long time to start using the real names,HRTHaumea was announced yrs ago yesterday fastest spinning large body in solar system Multiple moons Family of collisional fragments Wow,HRTMakemake was announced on the same day as Eris years ago Surface is covered in slabs of methane Awesome place Let go,HRTThings we ve learned If Eris had been at its closest point to the sun Clyde Tombaugh would likely have discovered it yrs ago,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs its surface reflects almost of the sunlight that hits it because of that frozen atmosphere,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs its orbit is inclined by degrees to the plane of the planets Which still doesn make sense,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has satellite Dysnomia that we think was formed in giant impact Maybe,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs it is much more massive than Pluto yet tiny bit smaller thus much rockier on the inside,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has very Pluto like surface composition though at the distance the atmosphere is frozen,HRTyrs ago today Lilah was days old And we announced the discovery of Eris Lilah was not pleased that was gone all day Sorry Lilah,HRThate to be the voice of Pluto sobriety or any sobriety but that whole Pluto atmosphere has collapsed in year thing smells fishy,HRTAnybody else think the two big craters on the left are from the impact of near contact binary KBO,HRTOther places likely to have cool CH flows Makemake Eris Quaoar OR Fun to see Pluto to better understand these too,HRTIn my view the ice flows are the coolest things found on Pluto so far Still want more Charon though,HRTSounds like people have water on Mars style press release fatigue Hard to blame them really,HRTJust interview by BBC presenter about Kepler who said look haven we more or less heard all of this before And um yeah kinda,HRTAs mentioned earlier today this is thoroughly awesome On reflection it remains awesome,HRTlove to see more of that dark terrain on Pluto THAT where welearn whether or not there is internal activity think Soon Ish,HRTAh Plenty of craters on Pluto where they re not covered by ices Which is of course what was expected all along,HRTHaze in the craters of Ceres OK That counts as awesome,HRTHappy to see my favorite wikipedia dwarf planet image updated so quickly,HRTOK Pluto That was fun Now back to work Today Europa Trojan asteroids And super secret project with the code name Phattie,HRTAwesomeness,HRTIt ice volcanoes all the way down,HRTthink we have winner,HRTSo what good word for frost moving around on surface to distinguish from geological activity My brain is failing to get one,HRTAlso worth noting that geologically active generally means interior rumblings Clearly frosts move around on Pluto surface,HRTMost are also hoping that Pluto is active just want better evidence If it true weknow soon Also if not,HRTIn current hallway conversations with planetary scientists most are unconvinced by the evidence that Pluto is geologically active,HRTwife opens wines pours me glass thanks honey,HRTok hard to argue with this one,HRTSure it OK to grandfather Pluto in as planet Also you can grandfather the Earth as flat too if that makes you feel better,HRTll be there at the Planetary Society thing tonight listening for the NH signal Come say hi Throw ice or something,HRTIf you re locallooking for place to geek out on Pluto tonight come to the Planetary Society event in Pasadena,HRTEvery time someone says Pluto looks really interesting thus should be planet Titan sheds an alkane tear,HRTOr maybe not Figuring out if that is plausible requires getting out the pencil and doing calculations Which too sleepy to do now,HRTequatorial ice melting decades earlier Once it starts it spreads around the equator Leaving the heart for last,HRTIs it coincidence that the heart is on the anti Charon side Maybe light from Charon provided just enough extra heat to start the,HRTMy best is that if you came back in years the heart would be gone which sounds kind of sad and dark regions would extend further,HRTBUT the bright patch really shouldnt be at the equator That one of the warmest spots The rest of the equator is ice free as expected,HRTNot surprising to have ice patches coming and going Pluto goes through seasonal temperature extremes so that is expected,HRTThat heart on Pluto sure is odd It appears to be thick ice patch that is being slowing eaten away at the edges,HRTAlso the dark patch at Charon north pole definitely looks more interesting than initially gave it credit for,HRTWatch Charon probably the most similar thing in the solar system to Orcus at least on the surface,HRTOhhh crater rays on Charon Awesome And might the tiny white splotches be my ice volcanoes want ice volcanoes,HRTUseful to keep in mind Pluto size and density in the context of other objects from the Kuiper belt,HRTHey so is it too early to suggest that the big heart on Pluto whatever it turns out to be be named Tombaugh,HRTBack in offered these thoughts on the critical question of whether Eris or Pluto is bigger on,HRTOdd that Eris is tiny bit smaller than Pluto but so much more massive They are quite different bodies in many ways Maybe we should go,HRTgood sign would be that Charon pole is not just darker but also red think weget color info soon,HRTPluto still pretty inscrutable at this distance More resolution please oh you will thanks,HRTendorse,HRTmonth ago suggested Charon would look like Uranus moon Ariel Similarities pretty good so far,HRTWe re approaching the summer solstice after which most of the northern ices might have headed south Process already starting now,HRTIn the fig the solid line shows the latitude of the sun time the dark regions show where the ice has evaporated white is ice,HRTHere figure from that HansenPaige paper showing how Pluto surface ices move around with time,HRTEven now that about all can say Amazing how fast this is all going to come and go and how much we will wish we saw but didn,HRTOn Charon the brightest spots are likely to be ammonia rich water ice flows Dark spots not dark just lack of water flows,HRTOK what about Charon Still too low detail want craters damnit And want them now But will have to wait,HRTConclusions even at this range it is really really hard to learn details of what is going on here Recommendation Go closer,HRTof that sort Your eye is good at playing tricks on you suspect that on the nicely imaged side yousee no giant polygons,HRTWhat are the polygonal features Not polygons Seems unlikely any physical process could form large scale linear features cont,HRTevaporating and going poleward Come back in years and it might look just like the equator Again nicely modeled in HansenPaige,HRTNorth of the dark equator are the patchy tropics Summer has started here recently so suspect this is where ice is currently cont,HRTStill weird that it is at equator Maybe something interesting going on there Keep your eye out,HRTThe heart could just be random feedback It bright so reflects sunlight so cold so gets icy gets brighter gets colder etc,HRTWhy is the dark equatorial band not continuous No clue The heart looks like the brightest spot on the surface and its equatorial,HRTdark substrate behind Dark substrate is probably tholins Tholins organic muck sorry,HRTby Hansen and Paige who showed how nitrogen evaporates from the warm equatorial regions and reaccumulates at the poles leaving cont,HRTThe dominant feature on Pluto is the dark but not quite continuous equatorial band This was nicely explained in in paper cont,HRTOK friends the Pluto and Charon images are good enough for new round of speculation Let start here,HRTThe latest Pluto images remind me of early adaptive optics images of Titan totally cool and thoroughly uninterpretable Soon though Soon,HRTJust back from vacation What all of this Pluto stuff everyone is talking about,HRTBiggest Pluto surprise to me so far is that New Horizons still hasn spotted any new moons have bet yes,HRTso far nothing on pluto Charon to be surprised about But images are quickly getting better Stay tuned,HRTCharon looks grayer because it too small to keep nitrogen or methane from escaping so only has old water ice on its surface,HRTpeach relatively fresh methane starting to degrade Dark old warm ice free degraded methane,HRTon Pluto darker spots get warmer drove off ices get warmer still drive off more ices etc etc So white cold nitrogen ice,HRTmethane breaks apart and turns reddish when exposed to sunlight and space Pluto is patchy probably because of feedback,HRTTime for your periodic Pluto speculations So far all is as expected Pluto is peach colored because of methane,HRTThe Tour de France passes right by our mooring here in Gouda And their wheels shall become cheese,HRTHappy AsteroidDay day on which you should ponder just how full of crap the people are who are trying to scare you about asteroids,HRTPluto likely mottled because of surface feedback slightly darker areas get warmer drive off ices get darker get warmer get darker,HRTWhy is Pluto so mottled looking Deconvolution will make it appear more so than it really is but we know that it really IS,HRTWhy don we see such ice on Pluto Likely there just covered in CH CO frostsmight be morphologically similar under the frost,HRTWhere do ice flows on Charon come from The ancient interior ocean now frozen out but once erupting onto the surface,HRTDark polar cap on Charon Unlikely to be dark ice frost cap but rather lack of bright stuff What is bright stuff Ice flows,HRTNow with that first go read this and then let do some idle speculation,HRTPro tip for New Horizons images of PlutoCharon be wary of sharpened and deconvolved images Don believe stuff unless in raw ones,HRTQuaoar Named after the Tongva tribe creation deity who sang and danced the world into existence lt Quaoar,HRTIn case you were worried actually like the real non planet Pluto,HRTICYMI my speculations yesterday on the latest Pluto images have been Storyfyed,HRTTruth is more excited to see Charon suspect it will look something like this,HRTthink we ve got some polar caps as expected The dark areas South at longitude look like the expected organic rich spots,HRTFirst step read little of what we think is on Pluto Even in we had some ideas start around Figure,HRTnot involved in New Horizons so am free to do purely speculative geological interpretaiton starting NOW,HRTAs of today the silly term Plutoid has been used in precisely zero titles or abstracts of refereed papers,HRTve heard of the dark run but this is ridiculous,HRTHold still Europa You re being analyzed this won hurt bit,HRTDear Europa we are about to spy on you We will learn your secrets We are like the NSA of the Jupiter system xoxoxo,HRTNASA might go to Europa within the next decade Methe Keck telescope are going there in about hours,HRTComing again in in case you missed Science of the Solar System,HRTScoop all of the good results from telescopes right here on earth in the next decade before the spacecraft gets there,HRTSad that none of the instruments on which was team member were selected to go to Europa But we will do what we always do,HRTEvery time someone says dwarf planet must be planet because of the name seahorse somewhere sheds salty tear,HRTAnother view The iron is almost mirror like Olive deep green translucent This one was gift from my class,HRTMy fav thinly sliced pallasite translucent olivine Hard to photograph,HRTBeautiful Widmanstatten pattern in this iron meteorite Pattern only forms in frozen cores of mini worlds,HRTThe core mantle boundary of shattered mini world Thanks mini world Sorry about the shattering pallasite,HRTIt chondrules all the way down AKA tiny chunk from the birth of the solar system,HRTThis is an awesome Fukang pallasite Huge olivine crystals,HRTThis No big deal it just PIECE OF THE MOON,HRTNeed to record new SciSolSys lecture today because that damned keeps finding new things on Mars Stop it already,HRTAlso everyone loves those really bright spots on Ceres think these are little more intriguing,HRTOK so the white spots on Ceres are dramatic and mysterious but check out all of those near global scale ridges too,HRTOur biggest sweetest orangest cat has passed Our home is sadder and emptier Also less orange So long Ike,HRTBut the estimate was still wrong The real mass of Pluto is only th of the Earth,HRTIn when the estimated mass of Pluto was revised down to only th of the Earth it was call disappointment,HRTSorry mean all going smoothly at Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea here tonight Spectacular place to be spying on the universe,HRTzong just found this thing that helps you stay awake at night its called coffee my friends and ill sell you some for one zillion dollars,HRTIt been interesting being here on the big Island listening to people about Mauna Kea The NYT is nicely balanced,HRTOne hour until sunset on Mauna Kea Then weopen up the Keck telescope and begin to understand the solar system little bit better,HRTNice byproduct of observing Europa with Keck is this sweet little image of Jupiter in the guide camera,HRTAMA on Reddit minutes,HRTdoing Reddit AMA on Saturday So you can ask me anything Really Anything at all Wide open Just not about Pluto OK Deal Promise,HRThave theory that using ice from the dark trailing side of Europa would result in the best gintonic ever like to test that idea,HRTThis sounds like it might be really good deal to me Wonder if it ever goes on sale though,HRTjust found this in the acknowledgements in paper wrote decade ago and LOLed out loud,HRTLilah was doing tessellations in math today and was all like let me introduce you to Escher and she was all like head explodes,HRTThis Pluto musical almost makes me feel sad for Pluto But Nahhhhhh,HRTGalileo hacked my data Claimed credit,HRTApparently Vikings DIDN wear hats with horns The things you learn teaching class about the solar system,HRTIn moment have been waiting for for years began reading Fellowship of the Ring to Lilah last night Finished in,HRTMars is now dead to me just finished recording all of my Mars lectures so have no more to do Mars is actually dead to me,HRTJust submitted telescope proposal with title search for planets in the distant solar system Don tell anyone though it secret,HRTLilah Sigh miss kindergarten Me What part It was just fun weary sigh How come no one told me it was the best time of life,HRTyrs ago we had just recently discovered Haumea and Eris and then came Makemake Plus my wife was months pregnant It was busy tune,HRTAnyone wonder why all of those bright dwarf planets were discovered yrs ago and nothing much since explain,HRTyrs ago today we discovered Makemake the nd brightest KBO after Pluto It was unsurprisingly nicknamed Easterbunny for awhile,HRTMy free online Science of the Solar System has now begun Students from every continent except Antarctica Anyone there like planets,HRTInterested in Science of the Solar System class but logging in to Coursera is too much work Check out the intro here,HRTMy free online class Science of the Solar System is now LIVE on Courera SciSolSys,HRTWhat The sneak preview to Science of the Solar System drops tomorrow You never heard it from me,HRTlike life on an ocean plate PacificPlateRules NorthAmrericanPlateDrools,HRTWe crossed the San Andreas fault twice today One of very small number of spots in

asked their permission first They named the moon Weywot,HRTMauna Kea full of snow But the skies are clear the sun is setting and we re off to discover things,HRTMy mother is in Iceland this week on aurora photography trip So she took this picture Nice timing mom,HRTGoal tomorrow night Discover new never before seen members of the Kuiper belt Then kill them Wait No That not it,HRTHere the talk summary Ceres is weird So Bethany Ehlmann and pointed telescope at it Which showed that Ceres is weird Seriously,HRTnot saying that Science of the Solar System is the best physical science MOOC on the planet but these guys do,HRTOnly weeks until the start of my free online Science of the Solar System MOOC,HRTSo much snow on Mauna Kew that telescope crews had to hike the last bit to the summit just to keep instruments full of coolant SkiHawaii,HRTMikebrown is eccentric oddly inclined and not very bright The asteroid mean Mikebrown Also capable of destroying humanity,HRTOn Titan it only seems to rain hard couple of times decade Which makes it like California only colder And with methane,HRTToo sleepy to tweet it last night but as seen from Keck Titan weather report Yesterday partly cloudy little chance of methane rain,HRTEuropa question for tonight where exactly is all of that hydrogen peroxide coming from We might know the answer in about an hour,HRTdon wanna jinx myself or anything but we found tiny tiny hole in the fog and clouds and are looking at Europa with Keck RIGHT NOW,HRTMe on Ceres The images now are just at that intriguing resolution that lets you make stuff up,HRTCeres and Pluto may become planets again soon Also this just in pigs soon to fly and something about monkeys too,HRTSo this morning she asked me if each baby is different and had the dad genes and the mom how do you get identical twins,HRTLilah after getting genetics lectures when asking last night how are babies made thought all night about one puzzling part,HRTMe It just little like kissing OH That totally makes sense Now tell me more about cells and genes and how they work FTW,HRTout of boys genes out of girls but how do the boy and girl cells get together so that they can share,HRTLilah just now How do you make babies Me Boysgirls have cells designed to merge and share the genes together and baby grows,HRTAnd because know you want to know here is the real Sci of the

miniplanet,HRTpotatoid,HRTHerschel coined aster oid which means star like because asteroids looked like unresolved points Except now they don bloboid,HRTIt kind of crazy that we can just sit here all night at the Keck telescope and take resolved images of Ceres like it nuthin,HRTSeriously people Ceres of course And no won kill it That would make me serial killer of dwarf planets,HRTWhoo hoo Ceres We got images We got spectra We got spectral images We got photons with long wavelengths,HRTunmentioned the combination of wood pig and fire is sure indication of intelligent life SciSolSys,HRTjust finished filming my last video for SciSolSys after starting in January and working non stop martini andanother third,HRTHey SciSolSys see the color You know what THAT means MT

useful of me You will not be disappointed that way,HRTDear World desperately trying to keep up with teaching online class to Expect nothing else useful of me this month Or next,HRTWeek of my free online solar system class is underway Not too late to start,HRTOceans on Enceladus Is that covered in my free online class Yup Is there still time to enroll Yup,HRTyes young man behind the counter will have good one In fact if all goes well may actually have two,HRTHere is the full HyperSuprimeCam field with that huge cluster looking tiny tiny,HRTAccidentally pointed near this cute cluster Now see if you can find it in the full field,HRTIn each minute HSC exposure we detect new objects in the Kuiper belt As you might guess am excited about this new instrument,HRTHyperSuprimeCam covers crazy amount of sky in each shot Check out all of those CCDs,HRTIt hard to tell what the weather is on Mauna Kea right now because the web cams are all covered in snow SkiHawaii,HRTHappy Makemake day Makemake was the last really bright KBO found Nine years ago today EasterBunny,HRTHey In hours the first two weeks of my free online solar system class go live SciSolSys Be there,HRTThe aftershocks clearly have plan think they are heading for the Ontario airport,HRTAh earthquake aftershocks How charming,HRTAnd there is instantly thread on my class discussion forum about whether Pluto should be planet have no one to blame but myself,HRTSo fun to read intros from everyone taking my FREE ONLINE solar system class of continents represented Antarctica where are you,HRTOK for context that was in the top ish biggest earthquakes felt in years of living in California,HRTOK help out the seismic hazard folks Did you feel that one,HRTholy crap nice earthquake,HRTThat intro lecture can be found here Also you get to take poll on why my hair looks green,HRTIf you re tempted to take my free online Solar System class but don know if it the right level for you check out the intro lecture,HRTFriday present to you my Science of the Solar System free online class is LIVE NOW days early SciSolSys,HRTOK everyone Can we now all step back and agree that these embargoes on scientific papers are irritating and stupid,HRTmy free online class starts on the Solar System starts Monday What else are you doing next week,HRTAlso wanna learn more about cool things like the new Sednoid You should take my free online class Really,HRTGreat discovery of new object in the same region as Sedna Why is this cool Read Sedna back story here,HRTThe seals are getting pretty excited about the outer solar system press releases today springbreak,HRTOhhh almost makes me feel bad about killing Pluto But honestly get over it,HRTYou are unlikely to be surprised by my FirstTweet,HRTEven if Lilah doesn agree check out the article It has lot of nice science in it by which mean Nice science,HRTAlso apropos nothing my pick for March Madness is ADHD followed closely by schizophrenia Though perhaps should have gone with OCD,HRTFor those asking the class is Science of the Solar System and you can sign up it free here SciSolSys,HRTthink this counts as the BICEP money shot,HRTcan get into the press site but the BICEP papers are now live,HRTNo chance to watch tonight as am here watching the cosmos instead,HRTIt become spectacular night on Mauna Kea Check out the faint moonbow on the cloud camera,HRTCurrently observing the trojan asteroid Hektor Out of respect we will not be observing Achilles tonight,HRTRain has stopped humidity has dropped Wake up Eyes on the sky By eyes really just mean meter across mirror,HRTHEY My free online class The Science of the Solar System starts in weeks Questions Ask me,HRTWhen was in high school me and my geeky friends would dissect every moment of Cosmos on Monday morning What re your kids doing tomorrow,HRTAlso when you re done drinking the Comos you might try watching Cosmos,HRTHey West coast It Comos time The Carl Sagan version is why an astronomer Your kids might say the same in yrs about this one,HRTSeems all scientists need to tweet opinion of Gravity Me think it great song but Alison Krauss should have sung one more verse,HRTcould and do watch this all night Saturn rising in the CFHT cloud cam Milky way sneeks in at the end,HRTThe sun is degrees below the horizon at Mauna Kea so the astronomers now come out to play Less wind tonight more trojans discovered,HRTMauna Kea Kohala Big Island Haleakala Maui Three volcanoes All in row Because PLATE TECTONCS,HRTSun is coming up here at Mauna Kea estimate that we discovered new Jupiter trojan asteroids last night Tomorrow maaawrrrr,HRTThis is an awesome analemma,HRTWanna see what all of this crazy Subaru observing ACTUALLY looks like filming it all for my online class,HRTThe Subaru telescope is having some glitchess at the start of night They re unplugging it and plugging it back in It really big plug,HRTOur goal for the next two nights will be discover few hundred small trojan asteroids out at Jupiter distance,HRTHey Titan is cold Its atmosphere stinks You can even skate there Cause solid methane sinks,HRTFor Flying to Titan Sure would be great Sorry about plutonium,HRTlove to go fly there It sure would be nice To know which kind of salts whales drink Under the ice,HRTEuropa has salt Which kind don know Chlorides or sulfates All mixed up with snow,HRTWhy Europa Cause it cool yo,HRTNice to see so many signing up for my free online Science of the Solar System class Means gotta get recording,HRTOnline class starts March but you can go sign up RIGHT NOW For free And watch the video preview,HRTve been working on this project for long time now and can finally officially officially announce it The Science of the Solar System,HRTFinding dwarf planets Is the thrill of my life But nothing as good As you being my wife For NotAsBadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRTlove you Like love Pluto By the way No longer consider you an adult BadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRTOrcus and Vanth are tidally locked We could be the same If only you were more dissipative BadDwarfPlanetValentines OnlyMaybeTrue,HRTMy heart as full of love as Ceres is full of water Water in Ceres is still largely theoretical BadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRTQuauar is shiny With quite funny name If your name were more funny love you the same BadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRTEris is yellow With quite high albedo It got high mass Um unlike you BadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRTSedna is red Haumea is blue Well not really blue More like white BadDwarfPlanetValentines,HRTThe only book in existence signed my me and Clyde Tombaugh,HRTHere is the state of the union at my house seconds ago Rommel,HRTdidn watch the state of the union but can tell via Twitter that the union remains snarky,HRTve diagnosed the rattle in my Subaru engine It the acorns that the mice have stored for the winter,HRTsad that got no video of the man playing guitar between Tesla coils last night But it looked like this,HRTjust saw man playing electric guitar in chainmail suite getting zapped with giant Tesla coils So there that,HRTThat said the Ceres data look pretty good But variability always makes me nervous Unless it my own data Then always believe it,HRTRemember just because the new report of steam coming from Ceres is published in Nature doesn necessarily mean it is wrong,HRTHey people in Cal kids Have you been to the Physics Forest yet Do go No Really,HRTve trying to construct the perfect tweet explaining how cool it was to see the Endeavour up close and can Just this go see it,HRTUp close the Endeavour looks little worse for the wear but it still an amazing see sight,HRTAnybody notice that the moon Jupiter looks like scale up version of Jupiter Callisto right this second Seriously Go get your binocs,HRTFirst up Canals on Mars How could you not start class with canals on Mars,HRTToday starting to record videos for my on line planetary science class Coming to computer near you in April on,HRTSometimes at sunset just sit and watch the nearly full moon rise outside my office window,HRTBut part of the Kuiper belt the cold classical part doesn fit into the story Which is weird See Even the tr dr version is tl,HRTSince they have the same size distribution the KB and JTs COULD be from the same source key hypothesis,HRTHere the tl dr version yes the Jupiter trojan asteroids and Kuiper belt objects have the same proportions of big vs med vs small objs,HRTWait is it actually legal for school not in Alabama to win the BCS Or are rare exceptions made for states bordering Alabama,HRTHappy th birthday to Eris the most massive dwarf planet known IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE true NotAsImpressiveAsItSounds,HRTOne last view of the Endeavour done in flowers,HRTnew icon the City of LA Rose Parade float leads with the Endeavour now hosted at the CA Science Center,HRTHappy th time the Earth has orbited the sun since an arbitrary time ago yay,HRTfor one don think you should call the Moon planet But ornery that way,HRTIf you think spherical things should be classified as planets Ceres is good Also go outsidelook at the much larger planet Moon,HRTCeres And its raw spectrum Cute little spherical asteroid no,HRTEuropa is just peeking out from the limb of Jupiter driving the telescope in that direction right this moment whales,HRTGanymede And it raw spectrum We re looking for compositional differences between the equatorpoles,HRTYou might be glad to know that we are done with Uranus for the evening ahem,HRTUranus rotates fast one of the storms is nearly off the limb already,HRTThe two bright dots on the faint disk are storms on Uranus with clouds high that sunlight reflects before being absorbed by methane,HRTIn the infrared Uranus is nearly invisible because of methane absorption but the faint rings still reflect sunlight,HRTThe sun Damnit Go away sun We are not through with Ceres,HRTReading on the current state of NASA It depressing to read even if you know it already,HRTKeck still closed the Europa eclipse we came to see is lost But we took out an Dobs and watched in real life Cause that how we roll,HRTWhoo hoo The winds are blowing so hard on Mauna Kea that the Keck telescope just blew sideways Um literally Closing for now,HRTYup asteroid Mikebrown,HRTThere is an asteroid named Mikebrown and today it makes its not very close closest approach of the year Merry Christmas from Mikebrown,HRTlocated the problem there man stuck in the engine,HRTThe candles are spent My friends have gone My family sleeps So to you all my friends bid happy solstice Summer beckons,HRTSolstice My favorite day of the year my family
