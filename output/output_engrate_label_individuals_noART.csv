scientists published about the km crater at Nix Olympica,HRTJeff Moore wouldn say Charon is as interesting as Pluto Not that there anything wrong with it Spencer It perfectly fine moon,HRTMuch of the geology team on New Horizons were grad students together on Voyager so they like to give each other hard time,HRTJohn Spencer This part looks like Mars if you ignore the temperature and the composition and everything else,HRTAs Grunsfeld likes to say science never sleeps aside Science would like to sleep now,HRTHere are the informal names being used for dark spots suggested by public campaign organized by,HRTguess Tweet takes the place of the traditional phone call these days,HRTAtmospheric science result,HRTCathy Olkin From the ground we knew there were lot of different colors on Pluto but we never imagined anything like this,HRTHere is the MVIC color data hope pics will make it online soon Charon pole is red,HRTThe not planets all those round worlds we ve visited to scale,HRTthink that the most dangerous possible thing to say about Pluto flyby that with it we re somehow done with the solar system We re not,HRTOh this don agree with How about the whole rest of the Kuiper belt Eris Makemake Haumea Sedna Orcus,HRTBonnie Buratti We have been monitoring from Earth what we now know is the heart on Pluto for years,HRTBagenal Pluto looked remarkably like Mars Much better than Mars though,HRTFran Bagenal says it unlikely New Horizons will reach interstellar space it going slower than Voyagers,HRTJust had an opportunity to congratulate Marc Buie on the quality of his pre New Horizons Hubble maps of Pluto,HRTRosetta looked at Pluto too,HRTNew Horizons best look at Pluto before close approach,HRTBowman We were seconds early Stern Our nav predicts came out to km closer to Pluto than aimpoint Well within spec PlutoFlyby,HRTRight now all images are being returned with JPEG like lossy compression We will get lossless ones eventually,HRTStern To my eye these pictures show younger surface on Pluto and much older and more battered surface on Charon PlutoFlyby,HRTGrunsfeld to Bowman What is the actual data rate think it lower than Bowman Yeah we wish it was PlutoFlyby,HRTasked if the new image showed evidence of hazes or clouds Stern replied he looked and hadn seen those or plumes yet,HRTXKCD What if What if New Horizons hit my car,HRTThere is lot of applause happening but it feels premature until we hear from New Horizons again,HRTSince it FAQ It will be hours until we hear from New Horizons because spacecraft is too busy scienceing to talk to us right now,HRTPress briefing coming up momentarily But still hours until we find out whether New Horizons survived flyby or not,HRTClosest approach PlutoFlyby,HRTThey are playing The Final Countdown,HRTThis is happening outside the press room and off NASA TV and not sure why,HRTMy first impressions of this image there are so many different things happening on this

encounter science results Pluto diameter composition atmosphere,HRTStern These first compositional measurements show us that the polar regions are compositionally very different from the dark regions,HRTStern People love turning little dots little points of light into planets and writing new textbooks from scratch,HRTGrunsfeld Pluto is capstone of our solar system exploration and also it opening up new realm,HRTStern explains color data is much more expensive in terms of bits to get it to the ground which is why more LORRI pics have come down,HRTStern We tested techniques we used to determine Pluto diameter on Charon and got the right answer radius km,HRTunderstand you have to put miles on graphics for Americans but for love of Pete why can you also put metric measurements,HRTStern We detected escaping nitrogen before expected Either escaping faster than we thought or mechanism is different than thought,HRTStern Pluto radius is km It settles the debate about the largest object in the Kuiper belt,HRTPSA will not respond to any questions comments about Pluto planetary status That is least interesting thing to discuss at PlutoFlyby,HRTPaul Schenk

GUYS ITS PLUTO,HRTalmost forgot My spacey shirt for today is Family Portrait by,HRTLooking good but my fingers need break will work more on it later,HRTWhile Pluto could have visible clouds atmos

talking to Earth amp should be fine Don panic,HRTScreen cap of communication with Canberra shows downlink is carrier only uplink is telemetry,HRTWe don know yet The most common reason for spacecraft

Chesley Bonestell Ice climbing anyone,HRTDazzling details in Saturn northern hemisphere brought to you by our cameras on Cassini,HRTOMG can type the word plants without it coming out planets Which just happened right now too,HRTOur drought magic trick Over the past yrs we slowly replaced grass with native planets Which look better Go us notactuallystinky,HRTAnd of course years ago Eris was Xena Makemake was Easterbunny Haumea was Santa It took me long time to start using the real names,HRTHaumea was announced yrs ago yesterday fastest spinning large body in solar system Multiple moons Family of collisional fragments Wow,HRTMakemake was announced on the same day as Eris years ago Surface is covered in slabs of methane Awesome place Let go,HRTThings we ve learned If Eris had been at its closest point to the sun Clyde Tombaugh would likely have discovered it yrs ago,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs its surface reflects almost of the sunlight that hits it because of that frozen atmosphere,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs its orbit is inclined by degrees to the plane of the planets Which still doesn make sense,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has satellite Dysnomia that we think was formed in giant impact Maybe,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs it is much more massive than Pluto yet tiny bit smaller thus much rockier on the inside,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has very Pluto like surface composition though at the distance the atmosphere is frozen,HRThate to be the voice of Pluto sobriety or any sobriety but that whole Pluto atmosphere has collapsed in year thing smells fishy,HRTAnybody else think the two big craters on the left are from the impact of near contact binary KBO,HRTOther places likely to have cool CH flows Makemake Eris Quaoar OR Fun to see Pluto to better understand these too,HRTIn my view the ice flows are the coolest things found on Pluto so far Still want more Charon though,HRTJust interview by BBC presenter about Kepler who said look haven we more or less heard all of this before And um yeah kinda,HRTAs mentioned earlier today this is thoroughly awesome On reflection it remains awesome,HRTlove to see more of that dark terrain on Pluto THAT where we ll learn whether or not there is internal activity think Soon Ish,HRTAh Plenty of craters on Pluto where they re not covered by ices Which is of course what was expected all along,HRTHaze in the craters of Ceres OK That counts as awesome,HRTHappy to see my favorite wikipedia dwarf planet image updated so quickly,HRTOK Pluto That was fun Now back to work Today Europa Trojan asteroids And super secret project with the code name Phattie,HRTAwesomeness,HRTIt ice volcanoes all the way down,HRTthink we have winner,HRTSo what good word for frost moving around on surface to distinguish from geological activity My brain is failing to get one,HRTAlso worth noting that geologically active generally means interior rumblings Clearly frosts move around on Pluto surface,HRTMost are also hoping that Pluto is active just want better evidence If it true we ll know soon Also if not,HRTIn current hallway conversations with planetary scientists most are unconvinced by the evidence that Pluto is geologically active,HRTok hard to argue with this one,HRTSure it OK to grandfather Pluto in as planet Also you can grandfather the Earth as flat too if that makes you feel better,HRTll be there at the Planetary Society thing tonight listening for the NH signal Come say hi Throw ice or something,HRTIf you re local amp looking for place to geek out on Pluto tonight come to the Planetary Society event in Pasadena,HRTEvery time someone says Pluto looks really interesting thus should be planet Titan sheds an alkane tear,HRTOr maybe not Figuring out if that is plausible requires getting out the pencil and doing calculations Which too sleepy to do now,HRTequatorial ice melting decades earlier Once it starts it spreads around the equator Leaving the heart for last,HRTIs it coincidence that the heart is on the anti Charon side Maybe light from Charon provided just enough extra heat to start the,HRTMy best is that if you came back in years the heart would be gone which sounds kind of sad and dark regions would extend further,HRTBUT the bright patch really shouldnt be at the equator That one of the warmest spots The rest of the equator is ice free as expected,HRTNot surprising to have ice patches coming and going Pluto goes through seasonal temperature extremes so that is expected,HRTThat heart on Pluto sure is odd It appears to be thick ice patch that is being slowing eaten away at the edges,HRTAlso the dark patch at Charon north pole definitely looks more interesting than initially gave it credit for,HRTWatch Charon probably the most similar thing in the solar system to Orcus at least on the surface,HRTOhhh crater rays on Charon Awesome And might the tiny white splotches be my ice volcanoes want ice volcanoes,HRTUseful to keep in mind Pluto size and density in the context of other objects from the Kuiper belt,HRTHey so is it too early to suggest that the big heart on Pluto whatever it turns out to be be named Tombaugh,HRTBack in offered these thoughts on the critical question of whether Eris or Pluto is bigger on,HRTOdd that Eris is tiny bit smaller than Pluto but so much more massive They are quite different bodies in many ways Maybe we should go,HRTgood sign would be that Charon pole is not just darker but also red think we ll get color info soon,HRTPluto still pretty inscrutable at this distance More resolution please oh you will thanks,HRTendorse,HRTmonth ago suggested Charon would look like Uranus moon Ariel Similarities pretty good so far,HRTWe re approaching the summer solstice after which most of the northern ices might have headed south Process already starting now,HRTIn the fig the solid line shows the latitude of the sun time the dark regions show where the ice has evaporated white is ice,HRTHere figure from that Hansen amp Paige paper showing how Pluto surface ices move around with time,HRTEven now that about all can say Amazing how fast this is all going to come and go and how much we will wish we saw but didn,HRTOn Charon the brightest spots are likely to be ammonia rich water ice flows Dark spots not dark just lack of water flows,HRTOK what about Charon Still too low detail want craters damnit And want them now But will have to wait,HRTConclusions even at this range it is really really hard to learn details of what is going on here Recommendation Go closer,HRTof that sort Your eye is good at playing tricks on you suspect that on the nicely imaged side you ll see no giant polygons,HRTWhat are the polygonal features Not polygons Seems unlikely any physical process could form large scale linear features cont,HRTevaporating and going poleward Come back in years and it might look just like the equator Again nicely modeled in Hansen amp Paige,HRTNorth of the dark equator are the patchy tropics Summer has started here recently so suspect this is where ice is currently cont,HRTThe heart could just be random feedback It bright so reflects sunlight so cold so gets icy gets brighter gets colder etc,HRTWhy is the dark equatorial band not continuous No clue The heart looks like the brightest spot on the surface and its equatorial,HRTdark substrate behind Dark substrate is probably tholins Tholins organic muck sorry,HRTby Hansen and Paige who showed how nitrogen evaporates from the warm equatorial regions and reaccumulates at the poles leaving cont,HRTThe dominant feature on Pluto is the dark but not quite continuous equatorial band This was nicely explained in in paper cont,HRTOK friends the Pluto and Charon images are good enough for new round of speculation Let start here,HRTThe latest Pluto images remind me of early adaptive optics images of Titan totally cool and thoroughly uninterpretable Soon though Soon,HRTJust back from vacation What all of this Pluto stuff everyone is talking about,HRTBiggest Pluto surprise to me so far is that New Horizons still hasn spotted any new moons have bet yes,HRTso far nothing on pluto Charon to be surprised about But images are quickly getting better Stay tuned,HRTCharon looks grayer because it too small to keep nitrogen or methane from escaping so only has old water ice on its surface,HRTpeach relatively fresh methane starting to degrade Dark old warm ice free degraded methane,HRTon Pluto darker spots get warmer drove off ices get warmer still drive off more ices etc etc So white cold nitrogen ice,HRTmethane breaks apart and turns reddish when exposed to sunlight and space Pluto is patchy probably because of feedback,HRTTime for your periodic Pluto speculations So far all is as expected Pluto is peach colored because of methane,HRTHappy AsteroidDay day on which you should ponder just how full of crap the people are who are trying to scare you about asteroids,HRTPluto likely mottled because of surface feedback slightly darker areas get warmer drive off ices get darker get warmer get darker,HRTWhy is Pluto so mottled looking Deconvolution will make it appear more so than it really is but we know that it really IS,HRTWhere do ice flows on Charon come from The ancient interior ocean now frozen out but once erupting onto the surface,HRTDark polar cap on Charon Unlikely to be dark ice frost cap but rather lack of bright stuff What is bright stuff Ice flows,HRTPro tip for New Horizons images of Pluto amp Charon be wary of sharpened and deconvolved images Don believe stuff unless in raw ones,HRTQuaoar Named after the Tongva tribe creation deity who sang and danced the world into existence lt Quaoar,HRTIn case you were worried actually like the real non planet Pluto,HRTICYMI my speculations yesterday on the latest Pluto images have been Storyfyed,HRTTruth is more excited to see Charon suspect it will look something like this,HRTFirst step read little of what we think is on Pluto Even in we had some ideas start around Figure,HRTnot involved in New Horizons so am free to do purely speculative geological interpretaiton starting NOW,HRTAs of today the silly term Plutoid has been used in precisely zero titles or abstracts of refereed papers,HRTHold still Europa You re being analyzed this won hurt bit,HRTDear Europa we are about to spy on you We will learn your secrets We are like the NSA of the Jupiter system xoxoxo,HRTNASA might go to Europa within the next decade Me amp the Keck telescope are going there in about hours,HRTEvery time someone says dwarf planet must be planet because of the name seahorse somewhere sheds salty tear,HRTAnother view The iron is almost mirror like Olive deep green translucent This one was gift from my class,HRTMy fav thinly sliced pallasite translucent olivine Hard to

it just PIECE OF THE MOON,HRTNeed to record new SciSolSys lecture today because that damned keeps finding new things on Mars Stop it already,HRTAlso everyone loves those really bright spots on Ceres think these are little more intriguing,HRTOK so the white spots on Ceres are dramatic and mysterious but check out all of those near global scale ridges too,HRTOur biggest sweetest orangest cat has passed Our home is sadder and emptier Also less orange So long Ike,HRTBut the estimate was still wrong The real mass of Pluto is only th of the Earth,HRTzong just found this thing that helps you stay awake at night its called coffee my friends and ill sell you some for one zillion dollars,HRTIt been interesting being here on the big Island listening to people about Mauna Kea The NYT is nicely balanced,HRTOne hour until sunset on Mauna Kea Then we ll open up the Keck telescope and begin to understand the solar system little bit better,HRTNice byproduct of observing Europa with Keck is this sweet little image of Jupiter in the guide camera,HRTAMA on Reddit minutes,HRTdoing Reddit AMA on Saturday So you can ask me anything Really Anything at all Wide open Just not about Pluto OK Deal Promise,HRThave theory that using ice from the dark trailing side of Europa would result in the best gin amp tonic ever like to test that idea,HRTThis sounds like it might be really good deal to me Wonder if it ever goes on sale though,HRTLilah was doing tessellations in math today and was all like let me introduce you to Escher and she was all like head explodes,HRTThis Pluto musical

was just fun weary sigh How come no one told me it was the best time of life,HRTAnyone wonder why all of those bright dwarf planets were discovered yrs ago and nothing much since explain,HRTyrs ago

would make me serial killer of dwarf planets,HRTWhoo hoo Ceres We got images We got spectra We got spectral images We got photons with long wavelengths,HRTunmentioned the combination of wood pig and fire is sure indication of intelligent life SciSolSys,HRTFirst gray hairs spotted on my head Senility imminent Look for tweets about Pluto being planet coming soon,HRTZOMG got to borrow pallasite for today class touching core mantle boundary SciSolSys,HRTThe wikipedia page on asteroid Mikebrown is kind of hilarious They forgot to mention that it oddly inclined too,HRTFor the record Peeps burn better after being soaked in white gas But they do not taste better,HRTYep Nothing good at all FormerPeeps fire HappyEaster,HRTNothing good is likely to come of this peeps fire HappyEaster,HRTUntil today had no idea that Pluto was bit like female penis,HRTLilah just now for the win love you until the end of numbers you can copy and thus discovers mathematical induction,HRTReading Love in the Time of Cholera fabulously and profoundly shattered any delusion had early in life that could ever be novelist,HRTPerhaps it is just easiest to never expect anything useful of me You will not be disappointed that way,HRTOceans on Enceladus Is that covered in my free online class Yup Is there still time to enroll Yup,HRTHere is the full HyperSuprimeCam field with that huge cluster looking tiny tiny,HRTIn each minute HSC exposure we detect new objects in the Kuiper belt As you might guess am excited about this new instrument,HRTHyperSuprimeCam covers crazy amount of sky in each shot Check out all of those CCDs,HRTIt hard to tell what the weather is on Mauna Kea right now because the web cams are all covered in snow SkiHawaii,HRTHappy Makemake day Makemake was the last really bright KBO found Nine years ago today EasterBunny,HRTHey In hours the first two weeks of my free online solar system class go live SciSolSys Be there,HRTThe aftershocks clearly have plan think they are heading for the Ontario airport,HRTAnd there is instantly thread on my class discussion forum about whether Pluto should be planet have no one to blame but myself,HRTOK help out the seismic hazard folks Did you feel that one,HRTholy crap nice earthquake,HRTThat intro lecture can be found here Also you get to take poll on why my hair looks green,HRTIf you re tempted to take my free online Solar System class but don know if it the right level for you check out the intro lecture,HRTFriday present to you my Science of the Solar System free online class is LIVE NOW days early SciSolSys,HRTOK everyone Can we now all step back and agree that these embargoes on scientific papers are irritating and stupid,HRTmy free online class starts on the Solar System starts Monday What else are you doing next week,HRTGreat discovery of new object in the same region as Sedna Why is this cool Read Sedna back story here,HRTThe seals are getting pretty excited about the outer solar system press releases today springbreak,HRTOhhh almost makes me feel bad about killing Pluto But honestly get over it,HRTAlso apropos nothing my pick for March Madness is ADHD followed closely by schizophrenia Though perhaps should have gone with OCD,HRTFor those asking the class is Science of the Solar System and you can sign up it free here SciSolSys,HRTthink this counts as the BICEP money shot,HRTcan get into the press site but the BICEP papers are now live,HRTNo chance to watch tonight as am here watching the cosmos instead,HRTCurrently observing the trojan asteroid Hektor Out of respect we will not be observing Achilles tonight,HRTHEY My free online class The Science of the Solar System starts in weeks Questions Ask me,HRTWhen was in high school me and my geeky friends would dissect every moment of Cosmos on Monday morning What re your kids doing tomorrow,HRTHey West coast It Comos time The Carl Sagan version is why an astronomer Your kids might say the same in yrs about this one,HRTSeems all scientists need to tweet opinion of Gravity Me think it great song but Alison Krauss should have sung one more verse,HRTcould and do watch this all night Saturn rising in the CFHT cloud cam Milky way sneeks in at the end,HRTThe sun is degrees below the horizon at Mauna Kea so the astronomers now come out to play Less wind tonight more trojans discovered,HRTMauna Kea Kohala Big Island Haleakala Maui Three volcanoes All in row Because PLATE TECTONCS,HRTSun is coming up here at Mauna Kea estimate that we discovered new Jupiter trojan asteroids last night Tomorrow maaawrrrr,HRTThis is an awesome analemma,HRTThe Subaru telescope is having some glitchess at the start of night They re unplugging it and plugging it back in It really big plug,HRTHey Titan is cold Its atmosphere stinks You can even skate there Cause solid methane sinks,HRTFor Flying to Titan Sure would be great Sorry about plutonium,HRTlove to go fly there It sure would be nice To know which kind of salts whales drink Under the ice,HRTEuropa has salt Which kind don know Chlorides or sulfates All mixed up with snow,HRTWhy Europa Cause it cool yo,HRTNice to see so many signing up for my free online Science of the Solar System class Means gotta get recording,HRTOnline class starts March but you can go sign up RIGHT NOW For free And watch

winter,HRTsad that got no video of the man playing guitar between Tesla coils last night But it looked like this,HRTjust saw man playing electric guitar in chainmail suite getting zapped with giant Tesla coils So there that,HRTRemember just because the new report of steam coming from Ceres is published in Nature doesn necessarily mean it is wrong,HRTUp close the Endeavour looks little worse for the wear but it still an amazing see sight,HRTFirst up Canals on Mars How could you not start class with canals on Mars,HRTToday starting to record videos for my on line planetary science class Coming to computer near you in April on,HRTSometimes at sunset just sit and watch the nearly full moon rise outside my office window,HRTHere the tl dr version yes the Jupiter trojan asteroids and Kuiper belt objects have the same proportions of big vs med vs small objs,HRTWait is it actually legal for school not in Alabama to win the BCS Or are rare exceptions made for states bordering Alabama,HRTHappy th birthday to Eris the most massive dwarf planet known IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE true NotAsImpressiveAsItSounds,HRTOne last view of the Endeavour done in flowers,HRTnew icon the City of LA Rose Parade float leads with the Endeavour now hosted at the CA Science Center,HRTHappy th time the Earth has orbited the sun since an arbitrary time ago yay,HRTIf you think spherical things should be classified as planets Ceres is good Also go outside amp look at the much larger planet Moon,HRTCeres And its raw spectrum Cute little spherical asteroid no,HRTGanymede And it raw spectrum We re looking for compositional differences between the equator amp poles,HRTYou might be glad to know that we are done with Uranus for the evening ahem,HRTUranus rotates fast one of the storms is nearly off the limb already,HRTThe two bright dots on the faint disk are storms on Uranus with clouds high that sunlight reflects before being absorbed by methane,HRTIn the infrared Uranus is nearly invisible because of methane absorption but the faint rings still reflect sunlight,HRTReading on the current state of NASA It depressing to read even if you know it already,HRTKeck still closed the Europa eclipse we came to see is lost But we took out an Dobs and watched in real life Cause that how we roll,HRTWhoo hoo The winds are blowing so hard on Mauna Kea that the Keck telescope just blew sideways Um literally Closing for now,HRTThere is an asteroid named Mikebrown and today it makes its not very close closest approach of the year Merry Christmas from Mikebrown,HRTlocated the problem there man stuck in the engine,HRTSolstice My favorite day of the year my family biggest celebration First heading to the woods to find tree for tonight candles,HRTDear Science Sometimes the amount

believing,HRTOnly potential orbits to check before we have searched for every possible bright KBO in the sky My computer keeping me warm,HRTWhen faced with baffling data there is really only one clear choice Go home AndHaveAMartini,HRTAlso when it gets below in LA people say IT FREEZING outside so it is likely that water freezes at much higher temp around here,HRTve ton of work to do but can tear myself away from this NASA virtual town hall Like watching the last bit of shipwreck go under,HRTWow NASA is currently have Town Hall meeting and essentially telling planetary scientists to look for new jobs Wow,HRTSeriously good If you re curious about who is planet and who is not and why you should go read this now,HRTWanna see comet ISON Keep an eye on this live camera from the summit of Mauna Kea over the next minutes,HRTIn astronomy spectroscopy is where the real science lives But the hot off the telescope data aren so pretty,HRTWhoa MT An ISON tail image to rule all others is my favorite now Any takers,HRTNice piece in Nature News on the oddities of UX and what it might mean for dwarf planet formation,HRTIn about hours we re going to observe comet ISON with the inch Palomar telesope Why Because we can that why,HRTfound this note snuck into the suitcase packed to go to Palomar Observatory,HRTSo this is just one tiny point in sea of turbulent data but my health insurance premium is dropping in First drop ever Hmmm,HRTlist possible dwarf planets probable The top includes MS about which we know nearly nothing Someone get on it,HRTDwarf planet fans have finally updated my dwarf planet page to include the latest size albedo measurements Look,HRTOK ok this was my pumpkin from last year But it better than this year so worth re post,HRTAlso Southern California whatever you do do not slow down on the freeways just because of rain Because then you know the rain wins,HRTThe mysterious sky falling liquid appears to be water Checked around

that would float,HRTToo late for me amp Europa Stupid shutdown We re back We now return you to your space related posts,HRTIt great to see everything coming back online after the shutdown but the amount of pissed off still have is not going away anytime soon,HRTLilah and just finally finished Romeo and Juliet The ending is not how Taylor Swift promised,HRTHey since we should have guvment by tomorrow does that mean we can fly and observe Europa with SOFIA hint no too late sucka,HRTstill sad about missing Europa data on Thursday night because of the shutdown but this breaks my heart,HRTExcept of course SOFIA is sitting in hanger in Palmdale and can fly due to the shutdown Tonight there will be no science,HRTUm no SOFIA is shut down Europa is still there but we on the ground will learn nothing except for the fruits of stupidity,HRTSOFIA just took off We re flying across the US tonight looking up at Europa learning its secrets It beautiful up here Cold clear no,HRTVery excited to hear Keith Noll talk on Trojan asteroid moons Except forgot he is NASA employee and not allowed to be here dps,HRTll have memorial for all of the tiny photons that went from the sun to Europa and back to the earth only to die on the cloudtops,HRTOh Wait No don SOFIA is still grounded because the stupid is currently winning against Europa There will be no flights No data,HRTAh ha Just figured out that the film crews crawling all over Caltech right now are filming for the new Cosmos,HRTJust kdding SOFIA can fly during the shutdown So there will be no data We will learn nothing Nothing at all Next chance,HRTweek from now the SOFIA airplane telescope will be landing with ton of new data to help us understand the surface of Europa Can wait,HRTDear Europa sorry but it looks like we might not get to learn your secrets with the next week nobudgetnophotons,HRTSo wonder if NASA IF telescope is still working tonight or if the photons headed its way spill aimlessly on closed dome instead,HRTOh hey forgot to mention as of this moment am on the summit of Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii because you know SCIENCE,HRTfresh crop of planetary science
