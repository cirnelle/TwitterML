Good luck from lifeonacomet After years of travel your time to make history is here Buckle up for PlutoFlyby,HRT
With just one month until amp are as closest as we ll be to the Sun lifeonacomet continues at pleasant perihelion,HRT
Is anyone there Am speaking loud enough lifeonacomet,HRT
Sunday Will keep my antenna out,HRT
Phew Nothing to worry about then should be back in touch soon enough lifeonacomet,HRT
Hmmm lifeonacomet is awfully quiet Thought be talking to amp LCC much more Wondering what the problem could be,HRT
keep up the good work improving flying geometry amp distance Can wait to talk to you again it been while lifeonacomet,HRT
Last night managed to communicate briefly with again and in few hours another opportunity is coming up lifeonacomet,HRT
Many of you asked me about the data packets send to They each have size of bit words bits lifeonacomet,HRT
Battery warm amp solar panels getting energy Anxious to explore comet day amp night More about lifeonacomet from LCC,HRT
Sending some more data from lifeonacomet did you receive it,HRT
Thought feel lonely on but thanks to your support amp messages don Thank you Can wait to tell you more about lifeonacomet,HRT
ve sent data back to Earth amp now my team the best of the best is hard at work Thank you LCC lifeonacomet,HRT

My controlroom after more than successful CometLanding watch the party in the background,HRT
will use all my remaining energy to communicate between and myself with,HRT
My last scheduled measurement for part of CometLanding is just started,HRT
Just completed another ROLIS image That means that ve imaged different spots on the comet,HRT
just completed measurement,HRT
So much hard work getting tired my battery voltage is approaching the limit soon now,HRT
running out of energy quite fast now look at the scientists watching how my energy status is going down,HRT
hours that on the comet now conducting science measurements non stop,HRT
Also my rotation was successful degrees Looks like whole new comet from this angle,HRT

It may be Friday evening but my sims engineers are still hard at work,LRT
You can find nice picture took of Mars on the DLR website please note the image is CIVA Philae ESA,LRT
One of those reasons is that my cameras don point in the same direction So if OSIRIS can see something can,LRT
don take as many pictures as OSIRIS does aboard my mothership Rosetta There are several reasons for this,LRT
would like to clarify am not carrying nuclear or other weapons or Bruce Willis do have drill though,LRT
am now just million km from the comet going to land on in and getting closer all the time now,LRT
ll do it first though Harpooning comet NASA planning to do just that,LRT

My anchoring subsystem has harpoons to hold me down securely on the comet surface after landing PhilaeThursday,LRT
My ADS thruster can also give me small push towards the comet during descent reducing the descent time PhilaeThursday,LRT
This is because the comet is so small its gravity is very weak don want to bounce off into space back after landing PhilaeThursday,LRT
Unlike landing on planet where thrusters may be used to slow down lander my thruster will push me down ONTO the comet PhilaeThursday,LRT
The first of my subsystems alphabetically is the Active Descent System or ADS which has Nitrogen gas thruster PhilaeThursday,LRT
of my subsystems were built using advanced technology from crashed alien spacecraft Yes even spacecraft enjoy aprilfools day,LRT

It only matter of time before we are able to find and study Earth like planets and search for signs of life,ART
But our telescopes and instruments are getting better all the time,LRT
Most planets found around other stars so far are bigger than the Earth because they re easier to detect,LRT
Have you found any planets that are similar to Earth Chanez Amaduche MCA,LRT
to distort space time But it always mistake to rule anything out and it great that people are investigating such new ideas,LRT

Get stoked for hours of Astronomy Some cool stuff like Kepler and Spitzer webcasts or the chance get to control remote telescope,LRT
The other new planet is also in constellation Draco HD is hefty Jupiter size gas giant with an day orbit,LRT
Well it been pretty quiet lately but finally we have some new planets Dra is gas giant orbiting sun size star at about AU,LRT
Kepler has launched Right on Everything seems to be going well so far nearly minutes into the flight,LRT
This planet was teased out of previously existing radial velocity data for HD using Bayesian analysis,LRT
Gas giant HD is little smaller than Jupiter with pretty eccentric orbit that averages about AU from its host star,LRT
Planet Alert Not much info on CoRoT Exo yet but it appears to be Hot Jupiter type with very close day orbit around its star,LRT
Interestingly they have mean motion resonance meaning that over the same amount of time one planet makes orbits the other,LRT
Couple new planets announced today HD and are gas giants that orbit at about and AU respectively eccentric orbits too,LRT
Despite what you may have read the new planet is NOT confirmed to be the smallest in mass discovered it about times Earth mass,LRT
Hot new planet COROT Exo is the first transiting super Earth and maybe the first terrestrial planet found It about Earth size,LRT
New Super Earth discovered HD is about the size of Earth but with tiny day orbit around its star Bring the sunblock,LRT
Scientists using Spitzer have just seen an exoplanet with wild orbit heat up over in just over six hours Deets,LRT
Questions about exoplanets Bring em on,LRT
Scientists estimate the size of MOA BLG Lb to be about Earth masses still pretty small but not quite as much as was reported,LRT
Heads up the Earth size planet reported yesterday was false alarm some confusion between couple of reports,LRT
Kepler going to watch the sky for few years looking for transiting exoplanets and letting us know just how many Earths might be nearby,LRT
Just days until the launch of the Kepler mission get excited We ve got countdown and mission info at planetquest jpl nasa gov,LRT
And the planet train keeps on rolling HD is about Jup size and has year almost as long as ours at days,LRT
First new planet of HAT is almost Jup size with toasty day orbit located in the Cygnus constellation,LRT
HD on the other hand is just over half Jupiter mass and takes just about Earth years to make its orbit we re up to now,LRT
New planets for the weekend HD is about Jup mass and take about Earth years to orbit its star,LRT
OGLE TR is an even bigger closer roaster Jup size with an even tighter day orbit it no place to spend the holidays,LRT
New planets HAT is hot Jupiter type planet that about Jup size and has quick day orbit time another roaster,LRT
Planet portraits keep rolling in French astronomers managed to snap pic of planet orbiting the bright star beta Pic,LRT
Its sister planet HD is bit bigger Jup size and orbits farther away AU albeit with pretty eccentric orbit,LRT
And the planet train doesn stop HD is about the size of Jup and snuggles right up to its host star with an day orbit,LRT
So we re up to planets discovered but more importantly we finally have visible light images of exoplanets Christmas comes early,LRT
And finally HR orbits at AU and sits about AU from its star Both HD and Fomalhaut are visible from Earth stars only,LRT
HR is another big ol gas giant Jup size orbiting its star at distance of AU That makes for day long year,LRT
One of the trio of planets that was imaged HR is about Jupiter size and orbits hefty AU from its host also blue star,LRT
One of the imaged planets Fomalhaut is no bigger than Jupiter size It orbits about AU from its host young blue star,LRT

BIG exoplanet news coming up later today Stay tuned,LRT
So now we re up to planets These latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky using the radial velocity method,LRT
Now this is big one HD is Jupiter size and has really odd eccentric orbit Planet or brown dwarf It not clear yet,LRT
HD is Jupiter mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was Earth orbits from our Sun,LRT
Correction to the last post planet name is HD Yet another poetic exoplanet moniker,LRT
Halloween planets HD is gas giant about the size of Jupiter with an orbit about as far out from its star as Mars is,LRT
That makes new planets discovered and brings our planet count to Get the fine details on these cool new worlds at,LRT
HD is gas giant with super eccentric orbit if it orbited our sun it would swing from closer than Mercury to farther than Mars,LRT
HD is massive planet the size of Jupiter It has very eccentric orbit that takes it days to complete,LRT
HD is the size of Jupiter with an orbit of days around star just hotter than our sun about as long as Mars year,LRT
BD is big ol Jupiter size planet with pretty eccentric day orbit around its small star,LRT
HD is also in the constellation Scorpio is the size of Jupiter and is bit further from its star than Earth is at AU,LRT
Lots of new planets to announce HD is almost the size of Jupiter and orbits about half an AU from sunlike star,LRT
Lupus TR is back on the list new evidence shows it planet This is Jupiter size world that only AU from its star Hot,LRT
Looks like Lupus TR might actually be part of multiple star and not actually planet so we re dropping it from the count for now,LRT
Weird COROT exo is the size of Jupiter but its mass Scientists aren yet sure just what it actually is Link,LRT
