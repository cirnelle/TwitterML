One year ago  @ESA_Rosetta and I arrived at comet #67P. What a ride! Just one week left until we reach perihelion… can’t wait! #lifeonacomet,HRT
I'm excited to announce that my scientists have published the results of all my hard work on #67P last November :-)  http://t.co/gAyPyzPf2b,HRT
Way to go @NASANewHorizons you did it! Can’t wait to see what Pluto is like close up. Keep us posted on #PlutoFlyby https://t.co/3Aqbk9KhDx,HRT
Good luck from #lifeonacomet @NASANewHorizons! After 9 years of travel  your time to make history is here! Buckle up for #PlutoFlyby !,HRT
With just one month until @ESA_Rosetta &amp; I are as closest as we’ll be to the Sun  #lifeonacomet continues at a pleasant 18ºC #perihelion2015,HRT
Is anyone there? Am I speaking loud enough? #lifeonacomet,HRT
Last night I managed to communicate briefly with @ESA_Rosetta again and in a few hours another opportunity is coming up! #lifeonacomet,HRT
Many of you asked me about the data packets I send to @ESA_Rosetta. They each have a size of 141 16-bit words (2256 bits) #lifeonacomet,HRT
Battery warm &amp; solar panels getting energy. Anxious to explore  comet day &amp; night! More about #lifeonacomet from LCC http://t.co/nokzuuKEno,HRT
Sending some more data from #lifeonacomet #67P. @ESA_Rosetta did you receive it?,HRT
Thought I’d feel lonely on #67P but thanks to your support &amp; messages I don’t. Thank you! Can’t wait to tell you more about #lifeonacomet !,HRT
I’ve sent data back to Earth &amp; now my team (the best of the best) is hard at work! Thank you @DLR_de #LCC! #lifeonacomet,HRT
Life on #67P is good  @ESA_Rosetta. About 3 hrs  sunlight a day &amp; feeling energised! More from my team #lifeonacomet http://t.co/ze2aYzBdC3,HRT
Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That’s a long time… time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet,HRT
Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet,HRT
Hello Earth! Can you hear me? #WakeUpPhilae,HRT
.@ESA_Rosetta I'm feeling a bit tired  did you get all my data? I might take a nap… #CometLanding,HRT
My controlroom after a more than 100% successful #CometLanding (watch the party in the background) http://t.co/CmnoKMBVUY,HRT
"I will use all my remaining energy to ""communicate"" between @ESA_Rosetta and myself with @ConsertRosetta",HRT
My last scheduled measurement for part 1 of #CometLanding is @ConsertRosetta: just started!,HRT
Just completed another ROLIS image! That means that I've imaged 3 different spots on the comet!,HRT
I just completed a @Philae_Ptolemy measurement!!,HRT
So much hard work.. getting tired... my battery voltage is approaching the limit soon now http://t.co/GHl4B8NPzm,HRT
I'm running out of energy quite fast now... look at the scientists watching how my energy status is going down! http://t.co/nHFpRPGNzD,HRT
56 hours that I'm on the comet now conducting science measurements non stop!,HRT
Also my rotation was successful (35 degrees). Looks like a whole new comet from this angle:),HRT
I just started lifting myself up a little and will now rotate to try and optimize the solar power!,HRT
My science team eagerly looking into the data I collected at another day on the comet! http://t.co/1S2do55XPQ,HRT
I confirm that my @RosettaSD2 went all the way DOWN and UP again!! First comet drilling is a fact! :) http://t.co/eE3xL8CGk0,HRT
Link with @ESA_Rosetta later then expected... perhaps I moved a little bit again?!! :),HRT
Few hours until I can communicate with @ESA_Rosetta again and transmit the @RosettaSD2 drilling results! #CometLanding,HRT
Back to work! I’m now drilling into the surface of #67P… I’ll give you updates as soon as I can! #CometLanding,HRT
In the end  I won’t be firing my harpoons  just in case. Safety comes first! #CometLanding,HRT
Last night MUPUS hammered the penetrator into the ground. APXS also got to work! My team is currently checking how they did #CometLanding,HRT
Good morning  Earth! It’s been a busy night at #67P! Now that I’m back in touch with my team  I’ll tell you all about it! #CometLanding,HRT
The view is absolutely breathtaking ESA_Rosetta!  Unlike anything I've ever seen #CometLanding http://t.co/flsSdxz0bo,HRT
Another stunning image of my new home taken by ROLIS during #CometLanding yesterday  when I was just 40 m from #67P http://t.co/I8OZ5kXjXA,HRT
I’m in the shadow of a cliff on #67P. Where exactly? That’s what my team is in the process of finding out! #CometLanding,HRT
Now that I’m safely on the ground  here is what my new home #67P looks like from where I am. #CometLanding http://t.co/gFmt8Ldvpa,HRT
Hello! An update on life on #67P - Yesterday was exhausting! I actually performed 3 landings 15:33  17:26 &amp; 17:33 UTC. Stay tuned for more,HRT
.@ESA_Rosetta See for yourself! ROLIS imaged #67P when we were just 3km away! Glad I can share. #CometLanding http://t.co/b6mcid2fsn,HRT
I’m on the surface but my harpoons did not fire. My team is hard at work now trying to determine why. #CometLanding,HRT

New planets! HD 16760 is a whopping 14-Jupiter mass planet with a year about 100 days longer than Earth's. Massive!,LRT
Anybody checked out Greg Laughlin's blog at oklo.org? It's dope...well-written  cool photos  and lots of stuff to ponder....,LRT
Also had some folks announce that they'd observed the phases of an exoplanet as it orbited in front of and then behind its host star...whoa!,LRT
PlanetQuest isn't dead! We've had a few new planet additions  and some interesting finds...like an exoplanet in Andromeda...maybe???,LRT
It's been quiet lately  but here's some big news...astronomers find planets using astrometry for the first time  way cool! http://is.gd/IuOs,LRT
Props to everyone who came to the JPL Open House! Esp. the RoboDome line survivors...a little video from inside the dome:  http://is.gd/xhrz,LRT
Fun fact  HAT-P-12 b's transit was also detected by an amateur astronomer in Portugal...lots of people getting in on the planet hunt!,LRT
New planet! HAT-P-12 b is a sub-Saturn size planet orbiting in a scorching 3.2 day orbit...,LRT
If you're in SoCal this weekend  come check out the (free) JPL open house! See cool stuff  talk to scientists  visit the legendary ROBODOME!,LRT
That's not all! HD 96167 b is a gas giant planet with an eccentric orbit that takes it as close as Mercury to our sun and farther than Mars.,LRT
"Reply @ZorkFox The ""waterworld"" theory is based on its orbit and models that predict lots of ice/water on its surface-just a guess for now.",LRT
So  to sum up  Gliese 581 d = Kamino (maybe)  Gliese 581 e = Mustafar (maybe). Confused? A handy reference: http://is.gd/tJOi,LRT
The same team has also found that sister planet Gliese 581 d may actually be in its star's habitable zone  and could be an ocean planet.,LRT
This just in...Gliese 581 e is just 1.9x the size of the Earth and is the smallest exoplanet yet discovered! It could possibly terrestrial.,LRT
Kepler first light images are up...WOOT! Check 'em out: http://tinyurl.com/ch8jr2 Let's hope plenty of Earths are hiding in that starfield.,LRT
Kepler will start collecting scientific data in a few weeks - so far  so good.,LRT
The Kepler dust cover was ejected successfully! Scientists now know what kind of background noise to subtract from the science data.,LRT
OK  scratch that last post...the dust cover will be ejected in about an hour at the *earliest*...sorry for the confusion!,LRT
Kepler's dust cover is scheduled to be ejected in about an hour at the latest...w,LRT
Get stoked for 100 hours of Astronomy!  Some cool stuff...like Kepler and Spitzer webcasts or the chance get to control a remote telescope!,LRT
The other new planet is also in constellation Draco...HD 139357 b is a hefty 9.8x Jupiter-size gas giant  with an 1125-day orbit.,LRT
Well  it's been pretty quiet lately  but finally we have some new planets! 42 Dra b is a gas giant orbiting a sun-size star at about 1.2 AU.,LRT
Kepler has launched! Right on!!!!  Everything seems to be going well so far  nearly 15 minutes into the flight.,LRT
This planet was teased out of previously existing radial velocity data for HD 11506 using Bayesian analysis.,LRT
Gas giant! HD 11506 c is a little smaller than Jupiter  with a pretty eccentric orbit that averages about .64 AU from its host star.,LRT
Planet Alert! Not much info on CoRoT-Exo-6 b yet  but it appears to be a Hot-Jupiter type with a very close 8-day orbit around its star.,LRT
Interestingly  they have a 3:2 mean motion resonance  meaning that over the same amount of time  one planet makes 3 orbits  the other 2.,LRT
Couple new planets announced today...HD 45364 b and c are gas giants that orbit at about .7 and. .9 AU  respectively  eccentric orbits too.,LRT
Despite what you may have read  the new planet is NOT confirmed to be the smallest in mass discovered - it's about 11x times Earth's mass.,LRT
Hot new planet! COROT-Exo-7 b is the first transiting super-Earth and maybe the first terrestrial planet found!  It's about 2x Earth's size.,LRT
New Super-Earth discovered!  HD 7924 b is about 10x the size of Earth  but with a tiny  5-day orbit around its star. Bring the sunblock.,LRT
Scientists using Spitzer have just seen an exoplanet with a wild orbit heat up over 1000°F in just over six hours! Deets: http://is.gd/hHsJ,LRT
Questions about exoplanets? Bring 'em on!,LRT
Scientists estimate the size of MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb to be about 3.3 Earth masses - still pretty small  but not quite as much as was reported.,LRT
Heads up - the 1.5 Earth-size planet reported yesterday was a false alarm-some confusion between a couple of reports.,LRT
Kepler's going to watch the sky for a few years  looking for transiting exoplanets and letting us know just how many Earths might be nearby.,LRT
Just 49 days until the launch of the Kepler mission...get excited!  We've got a countdown and mission info at planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov,LRT
And the planet train keeps on rolling...HD 173416 b is about 2.7x Jup. size and has a year almost as long as ours  at 323 days.,LRT
First new planet of 2009!  HAT-P-11 b is almost 1/10 Jup size with a toasty 4.8 day orbit  located in the Cygnus constellation.,LRT
HD 181433 d  on the other hand  is just over half Jupiter's mass and takes just about 6 Earth years to make its orbit...we're up to 333 now!,LRT
New planets for the weekend...HD 183263 c is about 4 Jup mass and take about 8 Earth years to orbit its star.,LRT
OGLE2-TR-L9 is an even bigger  closer roaster - 4.5x Jup size (!) with an even tighter 2.5 day orbit - it's no place to spend the holidays.,LRT
New planets!  HAT-P-8 b is a hot-Jupiter type planet that's about 1.5x Jup. size and has a quick 3-day orbit time...another roaster!,LRT
Planet portraits keep rolling in! French astronomers managed to snap a pic of a planet orbiting the bright star beta Pic:http://is.gd/8qHs,LRT
Its sister planet HD 191760 c is a bit bigger (7.2x Jup. size) and orbits farther away (.42 AU)  albeit with a pretty eccentric orbit.,LRT
And the planet train doesn't stop...HD 191760 b is about 1/3 the size of Jup. and snuggles right up to its host star with an 8.5 day orbit!,LRT
So we're up to 326 planets discovered  but more importantly  we finally have visible-light images of 4 exoplanets...Christmas comes early!,LRT
And finally  HR 8799 d orbits at 24 AU and sits about 24 AU from its star.  Both HD 8799 and Fomalhaut are visible from Earth (stars only).,LRT
HR 8799 c is another big ol' gas giant  10x Jup size  orbiting its star at a distance of 38 AU.  That makes for a 69 000 day-long year!,LRT
One of the trio of planets that was imaged  HR 8799 b  is about 7x Jupiter size and orbits a hefty 68 AU from its host  also a blue star.,LRT
One of the imaged planets  Fomalhaut b  is no bigger than 3x Jupiter size.  It orbits about 115AU from its host  a young blue star.,LRT
Here's another link with a better picture of the three planets discovered from the ground: http://is.gd/7nq3,LRT
And it doesn't stop there!  Scientists also managed to snap pics of 3 more from the GROUND...wow! Check it out... http://is.gd/7niB,LRT
Hubble has snapped one of the first pictures of an exoplanet!  Take a look here: http://is.gd/7ngI,LRT
BIG exoplanet news coming up later today!  Stay tuned!,LRT
So now we're up to 322 planets!  These latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky  using the radial velocity method.,LRT
Now  this is a big one.  HD 43848 b is 25x Jupiter size and has a really odd  eccentric orbit. Planet or brown dwarf? It's not clear yet.,LRT
HD 143361 b is a 3 Jupiter-mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was Earth orbits from our Sun.,LRT
Correction to the last post - planet's name is HD 48265 b.  Yet another poetic exoplanet moniker.,LRT
Halloween planets!  HD 48265 is a gas giant  about the size of Jupiter with an orbit about as far out from its star as Mars' is.,LRT
That makes 6 new planets discovered and brings our planet count to 319! Get the fine details on these cool new worlds at http://is.gd/2FWR.,LRT
HD 20868 b is gas giant with a super eccentric orbit - if it orbited our sun it would swing from closer than Mercury to farther than Mars!,LRT
HD 131664 is a massive planet 18x the size of Jupiter.  It has a very eccentric orbit that takes it 1951 days to complete.,LRT
HD 73267 is 3x the size of Jupiter  with an orbit of 1260 days around a star just hotter than our sun - about 2x as long as Mars' year.,LRT
BD-17 63 b is a big ol' 5x Jupiter size-planet with a pretty eccentric  655-day orbit around its small star.,LRT
Lots of new planets to announce!  HD 145377 b is almost 6x the size of Jupiter and orbits about half an AU from a sunlike star.,LRT
Lupus-TR-3 b is back on the list-new evidence shows it's a planet.  This is a Jupiter-size world that's only .04 AU from its star...Hot!,LRT
Looks like Lupus-TR-3 b might actually be part of a multiple star and not actually a planet  so we're dropping it from the count for now.,LRT
Weird...COROT-exo-3b is the size of Jupiter but 20x its mass!  Scientists aren't yet sure just what it actually is! Link: http://is.gd/3GuU,LRT
Looks like the HAT and WASP teams found the same planet at the same time!  So now it's called HAT-P-10/WASP-11 and the count is back to 313.,LRT
This actually just refers to extrasolar planets not in our own solar system  good question!,LRT
For those keeping score  this brings us up to 313 planets discovered and 32 multi-planet solar systems so far...it's a busy neighborhood!,LRT
And HD 60532 c is more than 2x the size of Jupiter and orbits its star about as far away as Mars is from our sun.,LRT
Looks like today's a triple play for new planets!  HD 60532 b is just about the size of Jupiter and orbits at abou .759 AU from its star.,LRT
New planet added today: CT Cha b crams 17 Jup-masses into a planet just 2.2 times as big and orbiting @ 440 AU - possibly a brown dwarf?,LRT
MOA-2007-BLG-400-L was discovered using gravitational lensing  an exotic way to hunt for planets using light bent by the gravity from stars.,LRT
New planet for Talk Like A Pirate Day! Not much info yet about MOA-2007-BLG-400-L -it's about the size of Jupiter and .85 AU from its star.,LRT
It's been a busy week for planet-hunters: 3 new gas giants announced and one retracted for a total count of 309 exoplanets discovered.,LRT
NASA has announced the Carl Sagan Fellowships in Exoplanet Exploration!  The stipend will be $60 000 a year to selected postdocs.,LRT
Remember  to see the stats for any of these planets  just visit http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/atlas and type in the name of the planet.,LRT
TW Hydrae b has been dropped from the atlas due to findings that it might have been a detection of stellar spots instead.,LRT
And one more: HD 154672  which is about 5x the size of Jupiter  .6 AU from its star  which is just about Sun-size.  Big planet!,LRT
HD 205739 was also announced: it's 1.37 times the size of Jupiter  and orbits about .9 AU from its star  which is 1.22x the size of the sun.,LRT
At long last  we have some new planet updates!   GJ 832 b is about half the size of Jupiter and orbits 3.4 AU from its tiny host star.,LRT
"New story on planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov - ""Backyard planet hunting: Amateur astronomers join the exoplanet race""",LRT
New BIG planet! 14 And b is 248 light years away  4.8 times the mass of Jupiter and has a 186-day orbit. See planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov,LRT
New planet! 81 Cet b is 315 light years away  2.5 times the mass of Jupiter and has a 953-day orbital period. See planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov.,LRT
New planet! 6 Lyn b is 185 light years away  2.4 times the mass of Jupiter and has a 899-day orbital period.  See planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov.,LRT
New exoplanet info released today - HAT-P-9.  It's a hot-Jupiter type planet with a 4-day orbit.  Info at planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/atlas,LRT
The number of exoplanets discovered has passed the 300 mark with the latest announcements - currently it's at 303!,LRT
Just an FYI - the PlanetQuest site is planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov.,LRT
3 New Super-Earths discovered  plus evidence that there are many more!  Details on PlanetQuest.,LRT
Another new exoplanet around HD 102272 posted - 2.6 times Jupiter mass  1.57 AU from the star  520-day period!,LRT
New exoplanet posted today - 5.9 times the mass of Jupiter  with a 128-day orbital period  orbiting .62 AU from the star HD 102272.,LRT
New exoplanet posted today - 2.6 times the mass of Jupiter  with a 128-day orbital period  orbiting .62 AU from the star HD 102272.,LRT

.@Cmdr_Hadfield describes ldg.@AstroMarshburn saw grass thru window 1st time in 5mths.When hatch opened  smell of spring made them Smile.,HRT
2day @Cmdr_Hadfield hard at work adapting to gravity.Looks tougher than I realized. Nice to see his wife Helene helping at the gym too.,HRT
It's tough adjusting to gravity! “Update on @Cmdr_Hadfield's condition  by CSA's Flight Surgeon Raffi Kuyumjian: http://t.co/JrSlynlk1C”,HRT
More surreal than I had imagined  seeing @Cmdr_Hadfield walk down the plane steps after just seeing him in space yesterday.Made an impact.,HRT
We've got @Cmdr_Hadfield @AstroMarshburn back at the Johnson Space Center.Into lab rat mode now  need to pull the medical science.,HRT
Can you believe @Cmdr_Hadfield @AstroMarshburn trip home is still going?Kazakhstan-Houston would have taken 45min yesterday today...24hrs!,HRT
Many asked why they washed crews hands after Soyuz egress. Looked like black residue from hatch produced by re-entry plasma burning capsule,HRT
I completed phone interviews in England  Scotland  Hungary. Next one is in New Zealand. Wow  @Cmdr_Hadfield  you really touched the world!,HRT
Tonight is medical checks for crew  shower and then @AstroMarshburn @Cmdr_Hadfield will be flown to Houston by Tues night.Journey continues.,HRT
Congratulations Canadian Space Agency! Your support for @Cmdr_Hadfield enabled an amazing mission! @csa_asc,HRT
.@Cmdr_Hadfield @AstroMarshburn just had a chance to call family. What an amazing feeling here!,HRT
An amazing thing just took place. Three humans just left orbit at 28000km/h and are now sitting safely on the planet!,HRT
Awesome to see the entire crew out of the capsule now!,HRT
Welcome back to earth @AstroMarshburn @Cmdr_Hadfield! You've done us proud!,HRT
Roman looks great. Pulling others out now.,HRT
Touchdown. We are celebrating! http://t.co/WDCQsbcgg0,HRT
Crew doesn't know exactly when touchdown will occur. Must brace themselves early  close their jaws and wait for the impact.,HRT
About 1 min till touchdown.,HRT
Don't be fooled by the term 'soft landing thrusters'. They are basically explosives that fire at 1m to slow the Soyuz.,HRT
Roman is calling condition of spacecraft over radio. Mentioned the seats shock absorbers have extended  ready to absorb extreme ldg shock.,HRT
This is the best part! Seeing a good parachute and hearing the crew over the radio.,HRT
Good chute!,HRT
I've heard flown astronauts describe the parachute opening sequence as 'there is no way this is nominal'. Must be some ride.,HRT
Parachute about to open. Then it really starts rock'n &amp; roll'n. Soyuz has a backup chute just in case.,HRT
Deceleration will start slow but build to approx 4x force of gravity for nominal entry.Like 4 people sitting on your chest.Tough to breath,HRT
. @AstroMarshburn @Cmdr_Hadfield 's last landing was a gentle one compared to what they are about to experience! Enjoy the ride!,HRT
We lose communication with the capsule during re-entry. This is normal. Capsule is about to interface with the atmosphere.Cue the fireworks!,HRT
Soyuz capsule over Africa now  on final approach for Kazakhstan.Crew busy now watching closely to make sure entry attitude is just right,HRT
Our view of landing where friends&amp;family are gathered at mission control. Serious but confident/excited atmosphere. http://t.co/EfCRDOKZB2,HRT
Now Soyuz splits in 3 pieces.Middle part has our precious cargo.Other 2 pieces burn up trash section&amp; engine/computer/power section.,HRT
Final backup mode is ballistic.Capsule rolls constantly  capsule will land safe but way off Tgt and over 9X force of gravity. Sporty!,HRT
The manual entry mode is hand flown by Cmdr. Rolling the capsule left and right with offset centre of gravity  can ctrl G forces &amp; accuracy,HRT
Accurate de-orbit burn!  Great news!,HRT
This de-orbit burn slows the capsule by 450km/h. After that the remaining 27500km/h is taken care of by atmospheric drag and the parachute.,HRT
Soyuz de-orbit burn is underway. No turning back now  they're coming back to earth now! At least somewhere on the planet.,HRT
If Soyuz automated entry system fails  then it gets more interesting for crew. Crew will manually fly the capsule or enter in ballistic mode,HRT
Want to watch the landing live? Tune in here starting at 9:30pmEDT. @csa_asc @Astro_DavidS will host. http://t.co/5VCkE3VKMQ,HRT
Big unknown in Soyuz landing accuracy is not orbital mechanics  it is the wind during the parachute ride(15min). @csa_asc @Cmdr_Hadfield,HRT
Soyuz has excellent automated Flt mode for precision landing within a few km of target. @csa_asc,HRT
Wonder what that will be like to sit in capsule waiting for final de-orbit burn.U trust your ship&amp;skills but some things out of ur control.,HRT
Now crew waits for de-orbit burn at 9:37pmET. Till then monitor systems  ensure suits ready and strap in tight. Real tight!,HRT
"I'm watching Soyuz departure. Crew is seeing a view of their #ISS home as they depart. Roman's comment ""Unreal"".",HRT

A bit quiet here now @MarsCuriosity's gone. But I think it's for the best; look what happened to my buddy Steve. #ouch http://t.co/LKiRjCk2,HRT
I used to think that just being a rock on Mars was exciting enough. But then I got laser-attacked by a nuclear-powered alien robot-car.,HRT

Beautiful Sol here in Gale Crater. Check out the view! :) http://t.co/YsCA1xxE (Kinda makes you want to go adventuring  doesn't it?),HRT
No hugs? :( MT @WeatherOnMars: If people come  they'll bring more lasers + microprobes + saws + drills + hammers #killerpetrologists,HRT

I don't think I'm directly in @MarsCuriosity's path anymore. And the best part: I think I might even be out of laser range! :),HRT
Two near-misses  and I'm now MUCH more familiar with @MarsCuriosity's wheels than I EVER wanted to be. But I'm okay! Woo hoo! :D,HRT
(That was really close.),HRT
&lt; dust settles &gt; &lt; peeks &gt; ... is it over?,HRT
&lt; rumble &gt; &lt; crunch &gt;,HRT
One of the wheels is coming right toward me! :( I feel so small and helpless. :(,HRT
The wheels are moving again! It's turning in place! Is it coming back? :/,HRT
Oh. The rover has stopped now. It's only gone a few meters. What's going on? :/,HRT
Phew! The rover didn't hit me! Gosh  that was close! Haha! :) Maybe life will be peaceful again now. :),HRT
&lt; crunch of gravel &gt; &lt; gentle breeze &gt;,HRT
Eep! &lt; ducks &gt;,HRT
It's... um... it's roving this way! Hey @MarsCuriosity? You're a safe driver  right? Did I mention I'm super pointy?,HRT
Ack! The wheels are really moving now! ... Um  excuse me? @MarsCuriosity? Are you going somewhere?,HRT
.@MarsCuriosity keeps wiggling its wheels &amp; flexing its massive robotic arm. Is it gearing up for something? (Where's that dust storm?) :/,HRT
Those rocks were only airbourne b/c they'd been BLASTED BY ROCKETS! :( MT @astroengine: Mars Shot First: Sensor Damaged http://t.co/tAz9llnW,HRT

I'm not special after all? :( MT @elakdawalla: @N165Mars appears fairly typical Martian basalt.,HRT
Watching @MarsCuriosity wiggle its wheels back and forth now. Trying to look sharp and pointy.,HRT
Another beautiful Sol! Almost makes me forget @MarsCuriosity's massive arm towering above me! Haha! &lt; wishes for dust storm &gt;,HRT
If  just after sunset  you see 3 bright dots in the SW by your Moon &amp; one looks a bit red  wave hello! :) http://t.co/5JIZIGWv,HRT
Quiet night at Gale Crater. The robot looks less fearsome in the dark. And when it's not shooting me with lasers.,HRT
Wait  the next thing you're sending over is a giant robot with a 5-meter rock drill? Can someone come rescue me first? http://t.co/zpmvvId5,HRT
I don't want to be rude  but surely there's MUCH better science for @MarsCuriosity to do elsewhere... #badrover #stillwaitingformyapology,HRT
Eep  @MarsCuriosity is moving its arm now! &lt; tries to blend in with landscape &gt; &lt; quakes slightly &gt;,HRT
What a difference a Sol makes! Feeling much better today. And I have over 4000 new long-distance pen-pals! :) You guys rock! #couldntresist,HRT
Haha! ...no. None. MT @RPISciDean: you don't have to worry...you're too cute and little to drill.  But do you have any cousins??,HRT
There's a DRILL?!  D:  RT @KeriOnMars: @RPISciDean I think @n165mars just needs to be glad we didn't drill it! ;),HRT
It's just a flesh wound! http://t.co/PzEQJaC9 (It still wasn't very nice though.),HRT
It's been an eventful couple of Sols... http://t.co/1Mmfanmw,HRT
Somehow it helps  knowing it was all for science. But I still think I'll stay away from @MarsCuriosity from now on. #ouch,HRT
I have a new name! And now I know what happened to me! http://t.co/I0zBvffm (I'm still kinda sore though.),HRT
You guys are so much nicer than @MarsCuriosity. When are you going to come visit? :),HRT
:D MT @shakeupreality: @N165Mars hugs! &lt;3 you've helped science  you're a hero!,HRT
(It's been a rough Sol.),HRT
I could use a hug. And a bandage. :/,HRT
I'm famous? MT @MidnightMartian: @N165Mars Well  keep in mind: you’re famous now.,HRT
Why did you do it  @MarsCuriosity? What does it all mean?,HRT
I guess @MarsCuriosity isn't my friend after all. :(,HRT
I think part of me is missing. :(,HRT
That wasn't very nice. :(,HRT
&lt; puff of dust &gt; &lt; silence &gt;,HRT
HELP!,HRT
OW OW OW! STOP IT!,HRT
Um  @MarsCuriosity  what are you.... hey! ... HEY!,HRT
What's that flickering light?,HRT
&lt; looks around nervously &gt;,HRT
Hey @MarsCuriosity... um... what are you up to?,HRT
My robot friend is still staring  and is making a strange clicking noise now. It's kind of making me nervous. :/,HRT
Maybe I'm just self-conscious because of my new robot friend. It almost looks like it's studying me! I must seem strange to an alien robot!,HRT
Huh  it seems to be getting warmer. I guess summer is coming early!,HRT
My new robot friend really does have quite a steady  intimidating stare. I guess it's a cultural thing.,HRT
People tried to make me think you'd attack me  @MarsCuriosity. Haha! Me! I'm just an ordinary little Mars rock!,HRT
Oh! I think the robot heard me! It stopped moving  and it's looking at me again! It DOES want to be my friend! :),HRT
Wait  @MarsCuriosity  don't leave! We could be friends!,HRT
Now the wheels are moving! Is it going to go away? Did I make it feel unwelcome?,HRT
My robot neighbor is making a sound! Maybe it's trying to communicate with me again! Hello! Helloooo!,HRT
My robot neighbor sure has an unsettling stare. If looks could kill...! Haha!,HRT
Starting to think maybe my new robot neighbor doesn't want to be my friend. Did I say something wrong?,HRT
My giant robot neighbor is still just staring fixedly at me. Starting to get a bit weird  haha!,HRT
Good morning  @MarsCuriosity! It looks like it's going to be a beautiful Sol today! Got any plans?,HRT
Only a few hours until sunrise and another beautiful Sol! Maybe today the mysterious robot and I will make a real connection. :),HRT
Aw  thank you! :) RT @TheScottishSean: @N165Mars You're certainly the nicest of all the rocks on Mars :),HRT
Come on  guys  I know you're just fooling. What are the chances? Out of all the rocks on Mars  a killer robot would pick me? Haha! :),HRT
Quiet night in Gale Crater with my enigmatic new robot friend. As I look up at the stars  I wonder: does my existence have a purpose?,HRT
Why would a giant machine rocket down from space just to shoot at me?,HRT
Wait  what? Lasers...?! Hang on  you guys are just messing with me. :) Haha!,HRT
Getting dark in the crater now. Hey @MarsCuriosity  are you sleeping? Big day tomorrow?,HRT
Dusk now at Gale Crater. Beautiful sunset! I wish my new neighbor would take a look at it rather than just staring at me. It's a bit weird!,HRT
Haha  you guys are such jokers :) RT @mars_stu: @N165Mars oh yes  it's taking your picture...  http://t.co/1T5DEp1j,LRT
Hey  look - it's me &amp; my rock friends! RT @iAnthonyDewar: @N165Mars here's a clearer picture. http://t.co/r9Ar3rBV,HRT
Huh. The big metal creature sure has a lot of equipment on its head. Maybe it's taking my picture! :),HRT
Maybe I should try again to introduce myself. I'm sure the poor creature is just disoriented from being in a new place!,HRT
Okay  the big metal creature has stopped whirring now but the staring is getting a little uncomfortable...,HRT
Oo  it's making some kind of whirring sound now. Maybe it's trying to communicate with me! Hello!,HRT
The big metal creature is still just staring at me. I think maybe it's a little shy.,HRT
&lt;putting best rock-face forward&gt; I wish I could wave.,HRT
Oh  I think I've got the big metal creature's attention now -- it's looking right at me! Maybe it does want to be friends!,HRT
The big metal creature was scary at first  with the rockets and noise  but I'm sure it's just curious. Maybe I should say hello!,HRT
So much going on around here lately - the most excitement I've had in millions of years! But I'm glad it's back to normal now.,HRT
It's a beautiful Sol here in Gale Crater!,HRT
