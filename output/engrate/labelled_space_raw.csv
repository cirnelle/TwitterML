My ADS thruster can also give me a small push towards the comet during descent  reducing the descent time. #PhilaeThursday,LRT,has_no_media

Also - WASP-18 b  which has the distinction of being the first dying planet found - it's got 1 mil. yrs. before SMACK - right into its star.,LRT,has_no_media
Meanwhile  CoRoT has discovered the first confirmed terrestrial exoplanet! It's one of two super-Earth size planets that orbit the star.,LRT,has_no_media
Ok  I'm back  and the planet news has piled up! For starters  cross WASP-9 off the exoplanet list - looks like it's actually a binary star.,LRT,has_no_media
In this case "b" is a roasting hot Jupiter with a 3-day orbit  and "c" is a portly 15xJupiter-mass planet with a super-eccentric orbit.,LRT,has_no_media
HAT-13-b and c have people pretty excited-it's the first time a multi-planet system with one transiting planet has been discovered!,LRT,has_no_media
Another new one  HD 110014b  is a little bit smaller @ 11 Jup masses  and has a pretty eccentric  egg-shaped orbit around its star.,LRT,has_no_media
Anybody checked out Greg Laughlin's blog at oklo.org? It's dope...well-written  cool photos  and lots of stuff to ponder....,LRT,has_no_media

New planet! HAT-P-12 b is a sub-Saturn size planet orbiting in a scorching 3.2 day orbit...,LRT,has_no_media
If you're in SoCal this weekend  come check out the (free) JPL open house! See cool stuff  talk to scientists  visit the legendary ROBODOME!,LRT,has_no_media
That's not all! HD 96167 b is a gas giant planet with an eccentric orbit that takes it as close as Mercury to our sun and farther than Mars.,LRT,has_no_media
Reply @ZorkFox The "waterworld" theory is based on its orbit and models that predict lots of ice/water on its surface-just a guess for now.,LRT,has_no_media

Get stoked for 100 hours of Astronomy!  Some cool stuff...like Kepler and Spitzer webcasts or the chance get to control a remote telescope!,LRT,has_no_media
The other new planet is also in constellation Draco...HD 139357 b is a hefty 9.8x Jupiter-size gas giant  with an 1125-day orbit.,LRT,has_no_media
Well  it's been pretty quiet lately  but finally we have some new planets! 42 Dra b is a gas giant orbiting a sun-size star at about 1.2 AU.,LRT,has_no_media
Kepler has launched! Right on!!!!  Everything seems to be going well so far  nearly 15 minutes into the flight.,LRT,has_no_media
This planet was teased out of previously existing radial velocity data for HD 11506 using Bayesian analysis.,LRT,has_no_media
Gas giant! HD 11506 c is a little smaller than Jupiter  with a pretty eccentric orbit that averages about .64 AU from its host star.,LRT,has_no_media
Planet Alert! Not much info on CoRoT-Exo-6 b yet  but it appears to be a Hot-Jupiter type with a very close 8-day orbit around its star.,LRT,has_no_media
Interestingly  they have a 3:2 mean motion resonance  meaning that over the same amount of time  one planet makes 3 orbits  the other 2.,LRT,has_no_media
Couple new planets announced today...HD 45364 b and c are gas giants that orbit at about .7 and. .9 AU  respectively  eccentric orbits too.,LRT,has_no_media
Despite what you may have read  the new planet is NOT confirmed to be the smallest in mass discovered - it's about 11x times Earth's mass.,LRT,has_no_media
New Super-Earth discovered!  HD 7924 b is about 10x the size of Earth  but with a tiny  5-day orbit around its star. Bring the sunblock.,LRT,has_no_media
Questions about exoplanets? Bring 'em on!,LRT,has_no_media
Scientists estimate the size of MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb to be about 3.3 Earth masses - still pretty small  but not quite as much as was reported.,LRT,has_no_media
Heads up - the 1.5 Earth-size planet reported yesterday was a false alarm-some confusion between a couple of reports.,LRT,has_no_media
Kepler's going to watch the sky for a few years  looking for transiting exoplanets and letting us know just how many Earths might be nearby.,LRT,has_no_media
Just 49 days until the launch of the Kepler mission...get excited!  We've got a countdown and mission info at planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov,LRT,has_no_media
And the planet train keeps on rolling...HD 173416 b is about 2.7x Jup. size and has a year almost as long as ours  at 323 days.,LRT,has_no_media
HD 181433 d  on the other hand  is just over half Jupiter's mass and takes just about 6 Earth years to make its orbit...we're up to 333 now!,LRT,has_no_media
New planets for the weekend...HD 183263 c is about 4 Jup mass and take about 8 Earth years to orbit its star.,LRT,has_no_media
OGLE2-TR-L9 is an even bigger  closer roaster - 4.5x Jup size (!) with an even tighter 2.5 day orbit - it's no place to spend the holidays.,LRT,has_no_media
New planets!  HAT-P-8 b is a hot-Jupiter type planet that's about 1.5x Jup. size and has a quick 3-day orbit time...another roaster!,LRT,has_no_media
Its sister planet HD 191760 c is a bit bigger (7.2x Jup. size) and orbits farther away (.42 AU)  albeit with a pretty eccentric orbit.,LRT,has_no_media
And the planet train doesn't stop...HD 191760 b is about 1/3 the size of Jup. and snuggles right up to its host star with an 8.5 day orbit!,LRT,has_no_media
So we're up to 326 planets discovered  but more importantly  we finally have visible-light images of 4 exoplanets...Christmas comes early!,LRT,has_no_media
And finally  HR 8799 d orbits at 24 AU and sits about 24 AU from its star.  Both HD 8799 and Fomalhaut are visible from Earth (stars only).,LRT,has_no_media
HR 8799 c is another big ol' gas giant  10x Jup size  orbiting its star at a distance of 38 AU.  That makes for a 69 000 day-long year!,LRT,has_no_media
One of the trio of planets that was imaged  HR 8799 b  is about 7x Jupiter size and orbits a hefty 68 AU from its host  also a blue star.,LRT,has_no_media
One of the imaged planets  Fomalhaut b  is no bigger than 3x Jupiter size.  It orbits about 115AU from its host  a young blue star.,LRT,has_no_media
Here's another link with a better picture of the three planets discovered from the ground: http://is.gd/7nq3,LRT,has_no_media

BIG exoplanet news coming up later today!  Stay tuned!,LRT,has_no_media
So now we're up to 322 planets!  These latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky  using the radial velocity method.,LRT,has_no_media
Now  this is a big one.  HD 43848 b is 25x Jupiter size and has a really odd  eccentric orbit. Planet or brown dwarf? It's not clear yet.,LRT,has_no_media
HD 143361 b is a 3 Jupiter-mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was Earth orbits from our Sun.,LRT,has_no_media
Correction to the last post - planet's name is HD 48265 b.  Yet another poetic exoplanet moniker.,LRT,has_no_media
Halloween planets!  HD 48265 is a gas giant  about the size of Jupiter with an orbit about as far out from its star as Mars' is.,LRT,has_no_media
That makes 6 new planets discovered and brings our planet count to 319! Get the fine details on these cool new worlds at http://is.gd/2FWR.,LRT,has_no_media
HD 20868 b is gas giant with a super eccentric orbit - if it orbited our sun it would swing from closer than Mercury to farther than Mars!,LRT,has_no_media
HD 131664 is a massive planet 18x the size of Jupiter.  It has a very eccentric orbit that takes it 1951 days to complete.,LRT,has_no_media
HD 73267 is 3x the size of Jupiter  with an orbit of 1260 days around a star just hotter than our sun - about 2x as long as Mars' year.,LRT,has_no_media
BD-17 63 b is a big ol' 5x Jupiter size-planet with a pretty eccentric  655-day orbit around its small star.,LRT,has_no_media
Lots of new planets to announce!  HD 145377 b is almost 6x the size of Jupiter and orbits about half an AU from a sunlike star.,LRT,has_no_media
Lupus-TR-3 b is back on the list-new evidence shows it's a planet.  This is a Jupiter-size world that's only .04 AU from its star...Hot!,LRT,has_no_media
Looks like Lupus-TR-3 b might actually be part of a multiple star and not actually a planet  so we're dropping it from the count for now.,LRT,has_no_media
Weird...COROT-exo-3b is the size of Jupiter but 20x its mass!  Scientists aren't yet sure just what it actually is! Link: http://is.gd/3GuU,LRT,has_no_media
Looks like the HAT and WASP teams found the same planet at the same time!  So now it's called HAT-P-10/WASP-11 and the count is back to 313.,LRT,has_no_media
This actually just refers to extrasolar planets not in our own solar system  good question!,LRT,has_no_media
For those keeping score  this brings us up to 313 planets discovered and 32 multi-planet solar systems so far...it's a busy neighborhood!,LRT,has_no_media
And HD 60532 c is more than 2x the size of Jupiter and orbits its star about as far away as Mars is from our sun.,LRT,has_no_media
Looks like today's a triple play for new planets!  HD 60532 b is just about the size of Jupiter and orbits at abou .759 AU from its star.,LRT,has_no_media
New planet added today: CT Cha b crams 17 Jup-masses into a planet just 2.2 times as big and orbiting @ 440 AU - possibly a brown dwarf?,LRT,has_no_media

A bit quiet here now @MarsCuriosity's gone. But I think it's for the best; look what happened to my buddy Steve. #ouch http://t.co/LKiRjCk2,HRT,has_no_media
I used to think that just being a rock on Mars was exciting enough. But then I got laser-attacked by a nuclear-powered alien robot-car.,HRT,has_no_media

It looks like @MarsCuriosity is going away to do science somewhere else. :/ I thought I preferred the quiet  but now I just want to explore!,HRT,has_no_media

Hey @MarsCuriosity -- you're really making tracks  now! Where are you headed? Somewhere fun? And  um  how long will you be away?,HRT,has_no_media
Beautiful Sol here in Gale Crater. Check out the view! :) http://t.co/YsCA1xxE (Kinda makes you want to go adventuring  doesn't it?),HRT,has_no_media
No hugs? :( MT @WeatherOnMars: If people come  they'll bring more lasers + microprobes + saws + drills + hammers #killerpetrologists,HRT,has_no_media
Woah! @MarsCuriosity is talking! Saying something about human exploration of Mars! :) #cantwait #comesoon #nomorekillerrobots,HRT,has_no_media
If you've never seen a Mars sunset  it looks kinda like this: http://t.co/fo25XIo8 #wishyouwerehere,HRT,has_no_media
My evening: watching a beautiful blue sunset  hanging out with the other basalts  comparing our new tattoos... #itsamarsrocklife,HRT,has_no_media
Sad to hear Neil Armstrong has died. He reminded us to reach for the stars &amp; dream big even if we are really very small http://t.co/iGTUEizC,HRT,has_no_media
Yay! Wait...jump? :/ MT @RPISciDean: yes  I can save you. Jump into one of the white trays on the rover deck and I will come get you. #MSL,HRT,has_no_media

Watching @MarsCuriosity  I've learned that science consists mostly of driving around shooting things with lasers. #canibeascientisttoo?,HRT,has_no_media

HEY! :( MT @SarcasticRover: SCIENCE is what you do when you want the truth about a thing that's too dumb / inanimate / imaginary to tell you,HRT,has_no_media
Did you know I was born in a volcano? Basalts like me come from lava. That's why we call it Olympus Mom. #areologyhumor,HRT,has_no_media
EXTREME CLOSE-UP! http://t.co/dQahBv48 (I feel so exposed. Yet strangely fascinated.) #science #ouch,HRT,has_no_media
It really is lovely here. Crescent Phobos overhead  Milky Way just rising... You guys should come see for yourselves! :) #nomorerobots,HRT,has_no_media
So peaceful &amp; quiet here at night! I can just lie here &amp; watch the stars &amp; dream of other worlds... (without being crushed or incinerated),HRT,has_no_media

It's a rock's-eye view of Bradbury Landing! (Can you see me? I'd be waving if I could!) http://t.co/8bXy7PMu,HRT,has_photo
Good morning from Bradbury Landing! :) http://t.co/REZ1RjzC (text) http://t.co/tJHQesvN (vid) #standtall,HRT,has_no_media
I don't think I'm directly in @MarsCuriosity's path anymore. And the best part: I think I might even be out of laser range! :),HRT,has_no_media
Two near-misses  and I'm now MUCH more familiar with @MarsCuriosity's wheels than I EVER wanted to be. But I'm okay! Woo hoo! :D,HRT,has_no_media
&lt; dust settles &gt; &lt; peeks &gt; ... is it over?,HRT,has_no_media
&lt; rumble &gt; &lt; crunch &gt;,HRT,has_no_media
One of the wheels is coming right toward me! :( I feel so small and helpless. :(,HRT,has_no_media
Oh. The rover has stopped now. It's only gone a few meters. What's going on? :/,HRT,has_no_media
Phew! The rover didn't hit me! Gosh  that was close! Haha! :) Maybe life will be peaceful again now. :),HRT,has_no_media
&lt; crunch of gravel &gt; &lt; gentle breeze &gt;,HRT,has_no_media
Eep! &lt; ducks &gt;,HRT,has_no_media
It's... um... it's roving this way! Hey @MarsCuriosity? You're a safe driver  right? Did I mention I'm super pointy?,HRT,has_no_media
Ack! The wheels are really moving now! ... Um  excuse me? @MarsCuriosity? Are you going somewhere?,HRT,has_no_media
.@MarsCuriosity keeps wiggling its wheels &amp; flexing its massive robotic arm. Is it gearing up for something? (Where's that dust storm?) :/,HRT,has_no_media
Those rocks were only airbourne b/c they'd been BLASTED BY ROCKETS! :( MT @astroengine: Mars Shot First: Sensor Damaged http://t.co/tAz9llnW,HRT,has_no_media
:D This is amazing! MT @Joi_the_Artist: http://t.co/SKVtbj6W Curiosity Shot First!,HRT,has_no_media
I'm not special after all? :( MT @elakdawalla: @N165Mars appears fairly typical Martian basalt.,HRT,has_no_media
Watching @MarsCuriosity wiggle its wheels back and forth now. Trying to look sharp and pointy.,HRT,has_no_media
Another beautiful Sol! Almost makes me forget @MarsCuriosity's massive arm towering above me! Haha! &lt; wishes for dust storm &gt;,HRT,has_no_media
If  just after sunset  you see 3 bright dots in the SW by your Moon &amp; one looks a bit red  wave hello! :) http://t.co/5JIZIGWv,HRT,has_no_media
Quiet night at Gale Crater. The robot looks less fearsome in the dark. And when it's not shooting me with lasers.,HRT,has_no_media
Wait  the next thing you're sending over is a giant robot with a 5-meter rock drill? Can someone come rescue me first? http://t.co/zpmvvId5,HRT,has_no_media
I don't want to be rude  but surely there's MUCH better science for @MarsCuriosity to do elsewhere... #badrover #stillwaitingformyapology,HRT,has_no_media
Eep  @MarsCuriosity is moving its arm now! &lt; tries to blend in with landscape &gt; &lt; quakes slightly &gt;,HRT,has_no_media
What a difference a Sol makes! Feeling much better today. And I have over 4000 new long-distance pen-pals! :) You guys rock! #couldntresist,HRT,has_no_media
Haha! ...no. None. MT @RPISciDean: you don't have to worry...you're too cute and little to drill.  But do you have any cousins??,HRT,has_no_media
There's a DRILL?!  D:  RT @KeriOnMars: @RPISciDean I think @n165mars just needs to be glad we didn't drill it! ;),HRT,has_no_media
It's just a flesh wound! http://t.co/PzEQJaC9 (It still wasn't very nice though.),HRT,has_no_media
It's been an eventful couple of Sols... http://t.co/1Mmfanmw,HRT,has_no_media
Somehow it helps  knowing it was all for science. But I still think I'll stay away from @MarsCuriosity from now on. #ouch,HRT,has_no_media
I have a new name! And now I know what happened to me! http://t.co/I0zBvffm (I'm still kinda sore though.),HRT,has_no_media
You guys are so much nicer than @MarsCuriosity. When are you going to come visit? :),HRT,has_no_media
:D MT @shakeupreality: @N165Mars hugs! &lt;3 you've helped science  you're a hero!,HRT,has_no_media
(It's been a rough Sol.),HRT,has_no_media
I could use a hug. And a bandage. :/,HRT,has_no_media
I'm famous? MT @MidnightMartian: @N165Mars Well  keep in mind: you’re famous now.,HRT,has_no_media
Why did you do it  @MarsCuriosity? What does it all mean?,HRT,has_no_media
I guess @MarsCuriosity isn't my friend after all. :(,HRT,has_no_media
I think part of me is missing. :(,HRT,has_no_media
That wasn't very nice. :(,HRT,has_no_media
&lt; puff of dust &gt; &lt; silence &gt;,HRT,has_no_media
HELP!,HRT,has_no_media
OW OW OW! STOP IT!,HRT,has_no_media
Um  @MarsCuriosity  what are you.... hey! ... HEY!,HRT,has_no_media
What's that flickering light?,HRT,has_no_media
&lt; looks around nervously &gt;,HRT,has_no_media
Hey @MarsCuriosity... um... what are you up to?,HRT,has_no_media
My robot friend is still staring  and is making a strange clicking noise now. It's kind of making me nervous. :/,HRT,has_no_media
Maybe I'm just self-conscious because of my new robot friend. It almost looks like it's studying me! I must seem strange to an alien robot!,HRT,has_no_media
Huh  it seems to be getting warmer. I guess summer is coming early!,HRT,has_no_media
My new robot friend really does have quite a steady  intimidating stare. I guess it's a cultural thing.,HRT,has_no_media
People tried to make me think you'd attack me  @MarsCuriosity. Haha! Me! I'm just an ordinary little Mars rock!,HRT,has_no_media
Oh! I think the robot heard me! It stopped moving  and it's looking at me again! It DOES want to be my friend! :),HRT,has_no_media
Wait  @MarsCuriosity  don't leave! We could be friends!,HRT,has_no_media
Now the wheels are moving! Is it going to go away? Did I make it feel unwelcome?,HRT,has_no_media
My robot neighbor is making a sound! Maybe it's trying to communicate with me again! Hello! Helloooo!,HRT,has_no_media
My robot neighbor sure has an unsettling stare. If looks could kill...! Haha!,HRT,has_no_media
Starting to think maybe my new robot neighbor doesn't want to be my friend. Did I say something wrong?,HRT,has_no_media
My giant robot neighbor is still just staring fixedly at me. Starting to get a bit weird  haha!,HRT,has_no_media
Good morning  @MarsCuriosity! It looks like it's going to be a beautiful Sol today! Got any plans?,HRT,has_no_media
Only a few hours until sunrise and another beautiful Sol! Maybe today the mysterious robot and I will make a real connection. :),HRT,has_no_media
Aw  thank you! :) RT @TheScottishSean: @N165Mars You're certainly the nicest of all the rocks on Mars :),HRT,has_no_media
Come on  guys  I know you're just fooling. What are the chances? Out of all the rocks on Mars  a killer robot would pick me? Haha! :),HRT,has_no_media
Quiet night in Gale Crater with my enigmatic new robot friend. As I look up at the stars  I wonder: does my existence have a purpose?,HRT,has_no_media
Why would a giant machine rocket down from space just to shoot at me?,HRT,has_no_media
Wait  what? Lasers...?! Hang on  you guys are just messing with me. :) Haha!,HRT,has_no_media
Getting dark in the crater now. Hey @MarsCuriosity  are you sleeping? Big day tomorrow?,HRT,has_no_media
Dusk now at Gale Crater. Beautiful sunset! I wish my new neighbor would take a look at it rather than just staring at me. It's a bit weird!,HRT,has_no_media
Haha  you guys are such jokers :) RT @mars_stu: @N165Mars oh yes  it's taking your picture...  http://t.co/1T5DEp1j,LRT,has_no_media
Hey  look - it's me &amp; my rock friends! RT @iAnthonyDewar: @N165Mars here's a clearer picture. http://t.co/r9Ar3rBV,HRT,has_no_media
Huh. The big metal creature sure has a lot of equipment on its head. Maybe it's taking my picture! :),HRT,has_no_media
Maybe I should try again to introduce myself. I'm sure the poor creature is just disoriented from being in a new place!,HRT,has_no_media
Okay  the big metal creature has stopped whirring now but the staring is getting a little uncomfortable...,HRT,has_no_media
Oo  it's making some kind of whirring sound now. Maybe it's trying to communicate with me! Hello!,HRT,has_no_media
The big metal creature is still just staring at me. I think maybe it's a little shy.,HRT,has_no_media
&lt;putting best rock-face forward&gt; I wish I could wave.,HRT,has_no_media
Oh  I think I've got the big metal creature's attention now -- it's looking right at me! Maybe it does want to be friends!,HRT,has_no_media
The big metal creature was scary at first  with the rockets and noise  but I'm sure it's just curious. Maybe I should say hello!,HRT,has_no_media
So much going on around here lately - the most excitement I've had in millions of years! But I'm glad it's back to normal now.,HRT,has_no_media
It's a beautiful Sol here in Gale Crater!,HRT,has_no_media
