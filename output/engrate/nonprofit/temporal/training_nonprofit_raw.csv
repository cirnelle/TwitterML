You @sallyosberg pioneered discipline of #socentship--@MauraLONeill at #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
Once we landed on the term #socent  @jeffskoll and I said  yes  that's what we want to do. @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
Distinguishing hallmark of #socent is that they set up a new equilibrium; they are ambitious @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
As you have looked at 100s of #socent what besides a big idea have you recognized in them?  @MauraLONeill to @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
#socents need to focus on replicability &amp; scalability if they hope to transform an unjust equilibrium--@SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
Figuring out the mechanisms for scale is the hallmark of scale for #socent.  @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
The paradigm of development is in need of a paradigm shift. @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
The #socent understands cultural context is key. In the book re: foot binding ending  it was partially because of reformers inside. S Osberg,LER,has_no_media
The women @MollyJMelching is working w have no clue that they have rights. The change comes from community-based ed @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
The #socent has to understand the economics that give rise to the status quo. @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
You cannot get rid of #FGC if people most vested don’t have alternatives. @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
Understanding context=critical. @tostan Molly Melching came 2 the #humanrights framework w/ affected communities @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
What surprised me was how much effective #socent involves working effectively w/government. @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
How successfully #socents unlock the potential of govts is one of the things that surprised me the most--@SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
In the epilogue of the book we are very clear that the stories we include are very much works in progress. @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
Yes we have set the bar really high and yes that means that some #socents will fail. @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
Interesting to think about #socents' life after @MauraLONeill. An impt Q &amp; just trying to figure that out ourselves @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media
In the next 15 years  how can we create the world we want to pass onto our children? @SallyOsberg #GWConf2015,LER,has_no_media

.@SallyOsberg on the 3 tensions which led @mollyjmelching @Tostan to her successful community empowerment program 20 yrs later,LER,has_no_media
These big problems are outstripping us. #socents need to identify the markers along the way to equilibrium change. @SallyOsberg @UW,LER,has_no_media
Extremism  terrorism  migration are complex problems  not a question of scale but understanding the complexity first. @SallyOsberg @UW,LER,has_no_media
Bill Foege cracked the code on smallpox w/circle vaccinations. A transformational @UW alum. @SallyOsberg w/Emer Dooley #getbeyondbetter,LER,has_no_media

We saw the need for someone to shed a light on #socent which led to our invest/connect/celebrate strategy @SallyOsberg,LER,has_no_media
#socents can act as R&amp;D for #SDGs--all 17 with 169 indicators. @SallyOsberg  w/ the awesome Emer Dooley @uw,LER,has_no_media
#socent see their expertise as going directly to those who have greatest stake in those problems being solved.  @SallyOsberg @UWFosterSchool,LER,has_no_media
#socents are not unlike unconditional cash transfers  empowering people directly. @SallyOsberg @UW,LER,has_no_media
.@SallyOsberg responds to @UWFosterSchool student who wants to be a #socent: What are others’ lessons learned? Something you can piggyback?,LER,has_no_media
