Well  it's been pretty quiet lately  but finally we have some new planets! 42 Dra b is a gas giant orbiting a sun-size star at about 1.2 AU.,LER,has_no_media
This planet was teased out of previously existing radial velocity data for HD 11506 using Bayesian analysis.,LER,has_no_media
Gas giant! HD 11506 c is a little smaller than Jupiter  with a pretty eccentric orbit that averages about .64 AU from its host star.,LER,has_no_media
Interestingly  they have a 3:2 mean motion resonance  meaning that over the same amount of time  one planet makes 3 orbits  the other 2.,LER,has_no_media
Couple new planets announced today...HD 45364 b and c are gas giants that orbit at about .7 and. .9 AU  respectively  eccentric orbits too.,LER,has_no_media
Despite what you may have read  the new planet is NOT confirmed to be the smallest in mass discovered - it's about 11x times Earth's mass.,LER,has_no_media
Hot new planet! COROT-Exo-7 b is the first transiting super-Earth and maybe the first terrestrial planet found!  It's about 2x Earth's size.,HER,has_no_media

Scientists estimate the size of MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb to be about 3.3 Earth masses - still pretty small  but not quite as much as was reported.,LER,has_no_media
Heads up - the 1.5 Earth-size planet reported yesterday was a false alarm-some confusion between a couple of reports.,LER,has_no_media
Its sister planet HD 191760 c is a bit bigger (7.2x Jup. size) and orbits farther away (.42 AU)  albeit with a pretty eccentric orbit.,LER,has_no_media
And finally  HR 8799 d orbits at 24 AU and sits about 24 AU from its star.  Both HD 8799 and Fomalhaut are visible from Earth (stars only).,LER,has_no_media
HR 8799 c is another big ol' gas giant  10x Jup size  orbiting its star at a distance of 38 AU.  That makes for a 69 000 day-long year!,LER,has_no_media
One of the trio of planets that was imaged  HR 8799 b  is about 7x Jupiter size and orbits a hefty 68 AU from its host  also a blue star.,LER,has_no_media

BIG exoplanet news coming up later today!  Stay tuned!,LER,has_no_media
So now we're up to 322 planets!  These latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky  using the radial velocity method.,LER,has_no_media
Now  this is a big one.  HD 43848 b is 25x Jupiter size and has a really odd  eccentric orbit. Planet or brown dwarf? It's not clear yet.,LER,has_no_media
HD 143361 b is a 3 Jupiter-mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was Earth orbits from our Sun.,LER,has_no_media
Correction to the last post - planet's name is HD 48265 b.  Yet another poetic exoplanet moniker.,LER,has_no_media
Halloween planets!  HD 48265 is a gas giant  about the size of Jupiter with an orbit about as far out from its star as Mars' is.,LER,has_no_media
That makes 6 new planets discovered and brings our planet count to 319! Get the fine details on these cool new worlds at http://is.gd/2FWR.,LER,has_no_media
HD 20868 b is gas giant with a super eccentric orbit - if it orbited our sun it would swing from closer than Mercury to farther than Mars!,LER,has_no_media
HD 131664 is a massive planet 18x the size of Jupiter.  It has a very eccentric orbit that takes it 1951 days to complete.,LER,has_no_media
HD 73267 is 3x the size of Jupiter  with an orbit of 1260 days around a star just hotter than our sun - about 2x as long as Mars' year.,LER,has_no_media
BD-17 63 b is a big ol' 5x Jupiter size-planet with a pretty eccentric  655-day orbit around its small star.,LER,has_no_media
