Have you ever wondered what it like to fly through deep space Then you might like to watch this video space SDSS,LRT
have 60 million km to go That roughly the total distance run by every runner of the London marathon for the past 40 years combined,LRT
see being followed by hope nobody thinks an Earth threatening asteroid Again,LRT

researcher explains how his simulations of Cometary nucleii and granular material applies to my mission,LRT
happy birthday to and launched years ago today,LRT
the force of gravity will be very close to the force necessary to stay on the surface and both vary depending on where land,LRT
hello to all my new followers If you have any questions about the Rosetta mission just ask,LRT
congratulations to my 500th follower gt,LRT
visited Mars few years ago amp took some lovely holiday pics will be making new home there in just 95 days Good luck,LRT
Thanks MT doing polarisation obs of comets your target is li faint for us at the mo will keep track,LRT
It nice to have people caring for you while you re asleep We re keeping close eye on your target,LRT
feel should do something special for my 500th follower ten to go any suggestions,LRT
There she is My destination MT amateur astronomers using sight Rosetta target comet,LRT
mission day 2968 distance to target 75 million km,LRT
The data from my mothership Rosetta OSIRIS camera during the Lutetia flyby is now available for download enjoy,LRT
one of my engineers will be at the student conference this weekend so get your questions ready if you re going,LRT

It may be Friday evening but my sims engineers are still hard at work,LRT
You can find nice picture took of Mars on the DLR website please note the image is CIVA Philae ESA,LRT
One of those reasons is that my cameras don point in the same direction So if OSIRIS can see something can,LRT
don take as many pictures as OSIRIS does aboard my mothership Rosetta There are several reasons for this,LRT
am now just 90 million km from the comet going to land on in 2014 and getting closer all the time now,LRT
ll do it first though Harpooning comet NASA planning to do just that,LRT
Sad to see the end of Phobos Grunt she had number of instruments and teams closely related to my own We were cousins in way,LRT

If Concorde was still flying and went in straight line through the Sun and could fly in space it would need over 46 years to reach me,LRT
years ago today my mothership and were wrongly identified as Earth threatening asteroid Today real roid flies past safely,LRT
My distance from the Earth doesn just increase because we re not traveling in straight lines Sometimes the Earth catches up little,LRT
Comet tails point away from the Sun because they re not caused by movement but by the solar wind radiation pressure,LRT
When operating each Tx unit is switched on hourly alternately by hardware mechanism to ensure they WILL be turned on,LRT
Being able to communicate with the Rosetta orbiter is vital to my mission So have transmitters and receivers PhilaeThursday,LRT
going to land on comet but robot Landing humans on an asteroid will be much harder via,LRT

ve been invited as special guest to ESA DLR SpaceTweetup at TdLR in Cologne 18 September gt,LRT
zzz It cold out here But all snuggled up in lots of blankets 40 layers of blankets in fact,LRT
weigh about 100Kg but the gravity at my destination comet will be so low ll weigh the equivalent of just noodles 2g on Earth,LRT
weigh about 100Kg At its peak of activity in 2002 my comet was pumping out approx 60Kg of dust PER SECOND More at,LRT
years ago just few months after was launched arrived at Saturn after journey which had also taken years,LRT
My scientists are still busy finalising the scientific objectives of my mission They re divided into 10 themes in 200 page document,LRT

PlanetQuest isn dead We ve had few new planet additions and some interesting finds like an exoplanet in Andromeda maybe,LRT
It been quiet lately but here some big news astronomers find planets using astrometry for the first time way cool,LRT
Props to everyone who came to the JPL Open House Esp the RoboDome line survivors little video from inside the dome,LRT
Fun fact HAT 12 transit was also detected by an amateur astronomer in Portugal lots of people getting in on the planet hunt,LRT
New planet HAT 12 is sub Saturn size planet orbiting in scorching day orbit,LRT
If you re in SoCal this weekend come check out the free JPL open house See cool stuff talk to scientists visit the legendary ROBODOME,LRT
That not all HD 96167 is gas giant planet with an eccentric orbit that takes it as close as Mercury to our sun and farther than Mars,LRT
Reply The waterworld theory is based on its orbit and models that predict lots of ice water on its surface just guess for now,LRT
So to sum up Gliese 581 Kamino maybe Gliese 581 Mustafar maybe Confused handy reference,LRT
The same team has also found that sister planet Gliese 581 may actually be in its star habitable zone and could be an ocean planet,LRT
This just in Gliese 581 is just 9x the size of the Earth and is the smallest exoplanet yet discovered It could possibly terrestrial,LRT
Kepler first light images are up WOOT Check em out Let hope plenty of Earths are hiding in that starfield,LRT
Kepler will start collecting scientific data in few weeks so far so good,LRT
The Kepler dust cover was ejected successfully Scientists now know what kind of background noise to subtract from the science data,LRT
OK scratch that last post the dust cover will be ejected in about an hour at the earliest sorry for the confusion,LRT
Kepler dust cover is scheduled to be ejected in about an hour at the latest,LRT
Get stoked for 100 hours of Astronomy Some cool stuff like Kepler and Spitzer webcasts or the chance get to control remote telescope,LRT
The other new planet is also in constellation Draco HD 139357 is hefty 8x Jupiter size gas giant with an 1125 day orbit,LRT
Well it been pretty quiet lately but finally we have some new planets 42 Dra is gas giant orbiting sun size star at about AU,LRT
Kepler has launched Right on Everything seems to be going well so far nearly 15 minutes into the flight,LRT
This planet was teased out of previously existing radial velocity data for HD 11506 using Bayesian analysis,LRT
Gas giant HD 11506 is little smaller than Jupiter with pretty eccentric orbit that averages about 64 AU from its host star,LRT
Planet Alert Not much info on CoRoT Exo yet but it appears to be Hot Jupiter type with very close day orbit around its star,LRT
Interestingly they have mean motion resonance meaning that over the same amount of time one planet makes orbits the other,LRT
Couple new planets announced today HD 45364 and are gas giants that orbit at about and AU respectively eccentric orbits too,LRT
Despite what you may have read the new planet is NOT confirmed to be the smallest in mass discovered it about 11x times Earth mass,LRT
Hot new planet COROT Exo is the first transiting super Earth and maybe the first terrestrial planet found It about 2x Earth size,LRT
New Super Earth discovered HD 7924 is about 10x the size of Earth but with tiny day orbit around its star Bring the sunblock,LRT
Scientists using Spitzer have just seen an exoplanet with wild orbit heat up over 1000 in just over six hours Deets,LRT
Questions about exoplanets Bring em on,LRT
Scientists estimate the size of MOA 2007 BLG 192Lb to be about Earth masses still pretty small but not quite as much as was reported,LRT
Heads up the Earth size planet reported yesterday was false alarm some confusion between couple of reports,LRT
Kepler going to watch the sky for few years looking for transiting exoplanets and letting us know just how many Earths might be nearby,LRT
Just 49 days until the launch of the Kepler mission get excited We ve got countdown and mission info at planetquest jpl nasa gov,LRT
And the planet train keeps on rolling HD 173416 is about 7x Jup size and has year almost as long as ours at 323 days,LRT
First new planet of 2009 HAT 11 is almost 10 Jup size with toasty day orbit located in the Cygnus constellation,LRT
HD 181433 on the other hand is just over half Jupiter mass and takes just about Earth years to make its orbit we re up to 333 now,LRT
New planets for the weekend HD 183263 is about Jup mass and take about Earth years to orbit its star,LRT
OGLE2 TR L9 is an even bigger closer roaster 5x Jup size with an even tighter day orbit it no place to spend the holidays,LRT
New planets HAT is hot Jupiter type planet that about 5x Jup size and has quick day orbit time another roaster,LRT
Planet portraits keep rolling in French astronomers managed to snap pic of planet orbiting the bright star beta Pic,LRT
Its sister planet HD 191760 is bit bigger 2x Jup size and orbits farther away 42 AU albeit with pretty eccentric orbit,LRT
And the planet train doesn stop HD 191760 is about the size of Jup and snuggles right up to its host star with an day orbit,LRT
So we re up to 326 planets discovered but more importantly we finally have visible light images of exoplanets Christmas comes early,LRT
And finally HR 8799 orbits at 24 AU and sits about 24 AU from its star Both HD 8799 and Fomalhaut are visible from Earth stars only,LRT
HR 8799 is another big ol gas giant 10x Jup size orbiting its star at distance of 38 AU That makes for 69 000 day long year,LRT
One of the trio of planets that was imaged HR 8799 is about 7x Jupiter size and orbits hefty 68 AU from its host also blue star,LRT
One of the imaged planets Fomalhaut is no bigger than 3x Jupiter size It orbits about 115AU from its host young blue star,LRT
Here another link with better picture of the three planets discovered from the ground,LRT
And it doesn stop there Scientists also managed to snap pics of more from the GROUND wow Check it out,LRT
Hubble has snapped one of the first pictures of an exoplanet Take look here,LRT
BIG exoplanet news coming up later today Stay tuned,LRT
So now we re up to 322 planets These latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky using the radial velocity method,LRT
Now this is big one HD 43848 is 25x Jupiter size and has really odd eccentric orbit Planet or brown dwarf It not clear yet,LRT
HD 143361 is Jupiter mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was Earth orbits from our Sun,LRT
Correction to the last post planet name is HD 48265 Yet another poetic exoplanet moniker,LRT
Halloween planets HD 48265 is gas giant about the size of Jupiter with an orbit about as far out from its star as Mars is,LRT
That makes new planets discovered and brings our planet count to 319 Get the fine details on these cool new worlds at,LRT
HD 20868 is gas giant with super eccentric orbit if it orbited our sun it would swing from closer than Mercury to farther than Mars,LRT
HD 131664 is massive planet 18x the size of Jupiter It has very eccentric orbit that takes it 1951 days to complete,LRT
HD 73267 is 3x the size of Jupiter with an orbit of 1260 days around star just hotter than our sun about 2x as long as Mars year,LRT
BD 17 63 is big ol 5x Jupiter size planet with pretty eccentric 655 day orbit around its small star,LRT
Lots of new planets to announce HD 145377 is almost 6x the size of Jupiter and orbits about half an AU from sunlike star,LRT
Lupus TR is back on the list new evidence shows it planet This is Jupiter size world that only 04 AU from its star Hot,LRT
Looks like Lupus TR might actually be part of multiple star and not actually planet so we re dropping it from the count for now,LRT
Weird COROT exo 3b is the size of Jupiter but 20x its mass Scientists aren yet sure just what it actually is Link,LRT
Looks like the HAT and WASP teams found the same planet at the same time So now it called HAT 10 WASP 11 and the count is back to 313,LRT
This actually just refers to extrasolar planets not in our own solar system good question,LRT
For those keeping score this brings us up to 313 planets discovered and 32 multi planet solar systems so far it busy neighborhood,LRT
And HD 60532 is more than 2x the size of Jupiter and orbits its star about as far away as Mars is from our sun,LRT
Looks like today triple play for new planets HD 60532 is just about the size of Jupiter and orbits at abou 759 AU from its star,LRT
New planet added today CT Cha crams 17 Jup masses into planet just times as big and orbiting 440 AU possibly brown dwarf,LRT
MOA 2007 BLG 400 was discovered using gravitational lensing an exotic way to hunt for planets using light bent by the gravity from stars,LRT
New planet for Talk Like Pirate Day Not much info yet about MOA 2007 BLG 400 it about the size of Jupiter and 85 AU from its star,LRT
It been busy week for planet hunters new gas giants announced and one retracted for total count of 309 exoplanets discovered,LRT
NASA has announced the Carl Sagan Fellowships in Exoplanet Exploration The stipend will be 60 000 year to selected postdocs,LRT
Remember to see the stats for any of these planets just visit and type in the name of the planet,LRT
TW Hydrae has been dropped from the atlas due to findings that it might have been detection of stellar spots instead,LRT
And one more HD 154672 which is about 5x the size of Jupiter AU from its star which is just about Sun size Big planet,LRT
HD 205739 was also announced it 37 times the size of Jupiter and orbits about AU from its star which is 22x the size of the sun,LRT
At long last we have some new planet updates GJ 832 is about half the size of Jupiter and orbits AU from its tiny host star,LRT
New story on planetquest jpl nasa gov Backyard planet hunting Amateur astronomers join the exoplanet race,LRT

More surreal than had imagined seeing walk down the plane steps after just seeing him in space yesterday Made an impact,HRT
Can you believe trip home is still going Kazakhstan Houston would have taken 45min yesterday today 24hrs,HRT
Congratulations Canadian Space Agency Your support for enabled an amazing mission,HRT
An amazing thing just took place Three humans just left orbit at 28000km and are now sitting safely on the planet,HRT
Welcome back to earth You ve done us proud,HRT
Touchdown We are celebrating,HRT
Crew doesn know exactly when touchdown will occur Must brace themselves early close their jaws and wait for the impact,HRT
About min till touchdown,HRT
Don be fooled by the term soft landing thrusters They are basically explosives that fire at 1m to slow the Soyuz,HRT
This is the best part Seeing good parachute and hearing the crew over the radio,HRT
ve heard flown astronauts describe the parachute opening sequence as there is no way this is nominal Must be some ride,HRT
Parachute about to open Then it really starts rock amp roll Soyuz has backup chute just in case,HRT
Deceleration will start slow but build to approx 4x force of gravity for nominal entry Like people sitting on your chest Tough to breath,HRT
We lose communication with the capsule during re entry This is normal Capsule is about to interface with the atmosphere Cue the fireworks,HRT
Soyuz capsule over Africa now on final approach for Kazakhstan Crew busy now watching closely to make sure entry attitude is just right,HRT
Now Soyuz splits in pieces Middle part has our precious cargo Other pieces burn up trash section amp engine computer power section,HRT
Final backup mode is ballistic Capsule rolls constantly capsule will land safe but way off Tgt and over 9X force of gravity Sporty,HRT
Accurate de orbit burn Great news,HRT
This de orbit burn slows the capsule by 450km After that the remaining 27500km is taken care of by atmospheric drag and the parachute,HRT
Soyuz de orbit burn is underway No turning back now they re coming back to earth now At least somewhere on the planet,HRT
If Soyuz automated entry system fails then it gets more interesting for crew Crew will manually fly the capsule or enter in ballistic mode,HRT
Want to watch the landing live Tune in here starting at 30pmEDT will host,HRT
Big unknown in Soyuz landing accuracy is not orbital mechanics it is the wind during the parachute ride 15min,HRT
Now crew waits for de orbit burn at 37pmET Till then monitor systems ensure suits ready and strap in tight Real tight,HRT
thankyoucommanderhadfield Your tremendous efforts amp perspective have reminded us to appreciate our planet and its people Safe trip home,HRT
