Happy Friday the 13th Earthlings Especially astronomy teacher my 350th follower Please say hi to your students for me,LRT
lots of my scientists are congregating in the Netherlands this week for the Rosetta Science Operations Working Group meeting,LRT
ISIC International Space Innovation Centre,LRT
If Concorde was still flying and went in straight line through the Sun and could fly in space it would need over 46 years to reach me,LRT
My distance from the Earth doesn just increase because we re not traveling in straight lines Sometimes the Earth catches up little,LRT
Comet tails point away from the Sun because they re not caused by movement but by the solar wind radiation pressure,LRT
When operating each Tx unit is switched on hourly alternately by hardware mechanism to ensure they WILL be turned on,LRT
Being able to communicate with the Rosetta orbiter is vital to my mission So have transmitters and receivers PhilaeThursday,LRT
Comets are one of the few things you can shoot with harpoon and then expect people to say Great Shoot it again PhilaeThursday,LRT
be chasin an icy beast through the black sea of space and when get in range ll be firing me harpoons Arr pirate,LRT
Paolo Ferri is talking about Rosetta now at spacetweetup,LRT
Guten morgen everybody in the tdlr tweetup tent,LRT
Here the control room adjacent to my own It used by ISS expts MSL and Biolab,LRT
Anybody visiting my control room this Sunday will be able to see full size model of me and pose questions to my operations team tdlr,LRT
Hello SpaceTweeps Did you know my control centre is at DLR Cologne You can take look when you re visiting on Sep 18 Building 29 MUSC,LRT
ve been invited as special guest to ESA DLR SpaceTweetup at TdLR in Cologne 18 September gt,LRT
zzz It cold out here But all snuggled up in lots of blankets 40 layers of blankets in fact,LRT
weigh about 100Kg but the gravity at my destination comet will be so low ll weigh the equivalent of just noodles 2g on Earth,LRT
weigh about 100Kg At its peak of activity in 2002 my comet was pumping out approx 60Kg of dust PER SECOND More at,LRT
My scientists are still busy finalising the scientific objectives of my mission They re divided into 10 themes in 200 page document,LRT
My ground engineers are in Cologne too too far away to take photo though Cologne Germany,LRT
Subsystem is CDMS my flight computer It full of redundant systems to be fault tolerant and runs unique OS PhilaeThursday,LRT
My anchoring subsystem has harpoons to hold me down securely on the comet surface after landing PhilaeThursday,LRT
My ADS thruster can also give me small push towards the comet during descent reducing the descent time PhilaeThursday,LRT
The first of my subsystems alphabetically is the Active Descent System or ADS which has Nitrogen gas thruster PhilaeThursday,LRT
Just added myself to the twitter directory under space comets spacecraft spaceflight spaceship spaceexploration,LRT
The carbon fibre rods used to make my legs will soon be used in laser cutting machines PhilaeThursday,LRT
have special message from my ground controllers in Cologne for all you Earthlings lle Alaaf PhilaeThursday,LRT
Rosetta and are on course for comet 67 after successful Deep Space Maneuver PhilaeThursday,LRT
My engineers scientists are looking fwd to seeing results of Stardust NExT flyby still so much we don know abt comets PhilaeThursday,LRT
Congrats to the Stardust NExT team on their flyby of comet Tempel,LRT
The distance between me and the Earth is actually decreasing at the moment can anybody guess why,LRT
my clever science team are still busy analyzing possible descents for me at the comet can safely land at up to km PhilaeThursday,LRT
update is little late this week sorry,LRT
Happy Birthday to my Project Manager Stephan Ulamec PhilaeThursday,LRT
can talk to my ground controllers directly Rosetta passes my messages to Earth with its powerful antenna vice versa PhilaeThursday,LRT
The check out is over have started my long Hibernation Phase on DOY 342 08 Dec 2010 at 23 47 UTC zzzzzzzz,LRT
checkout is going well ve had new version of my flight software uploaded and am now preparing to rehearse the landing,LRT
My ground engineers are busy preparing for PC13 the last chance to checkout my systems and instruments until 2014 PhilaeThursday,LRT
continued The change came when my launch was delayed by year and my planned route to Wirtanen became impossible PhilaeThursday,LRT
Although am flying towards comet 67 Churyumov Gerasimenko was originally designed to land on comet 46 Wirtanen PhilaeThursday,LRT
am being carried by the Rosetta probe My name comes from temple in Egypt closely associated with the Rosetta stone PhilaeThursday,LRT

Get stoked for 100 hours of Astronomy Some cool stuff like Kepler and Spitzer webcasts or the chance get to control remote telescope,LRT
The other new planet is also in constellation Draco HD 139357 is hefty 8x Jupiter size gas giant with an 1125 day orbit,LRT
Well it been pretty quiet lately but finally we have some new planets 42 Dra is gas giant orbiting sun size star at about AU,LRT
Kepler has launched Right on Everything seems to be going well so far nearly 15 minutes into the flight,LRT
This planet was teased out of previously existing radial velocity data for HD 11506 using Bayesian analysis,LRT
Gas giant HD 11506 is little smaller than Jupiter with pretty eccentric orbit that averages about 64 AU from its host star,LRT
Planet Alert Not much info on CoRoT Exo yet but it appears to be Hot Jupiter type with very close day orbit around its star,LRT
Interestingly they have mean motion resonance meaning that over the same amount of time one planet makes orbits the other,LRT
Couple new planets announced today HD 45364 and are gas giants that orbit at about and AU respectively eccentric orbits too,LRT
Despite what you may have read the new planet is NOT confirmed to be the smallest in mass discovered it about 11x times Earth mass,LRT
Hot new planet COROT Exo is the first transiting super Earth and maybe the first terrestrial planet found It about 2x Earth size,LRT
New Super Earth discovered HD 7924 is about 10x the size of Earth but with tiny day orbit around its star Bring the sunblock,LRT
Scientists using Spitzer have just seen an exoplanet with wild orbit heat up over 1000 in just over six hours Deets,LRT
Questions about exoplanets Bring em on,LRT
Scientists estimate the size of MOA 2007 BLG 192Lb to be about Earth masses still pretty small but not quite as much as was reported,LRT
Heads up the Earth size planet reported yesterday was false alarm some confusion between couple of reports,LRT
Kepler going to watch the sky for few years looking for transiting exoplanets and letting us know just how many Earths might be nearby,LRT
Just 49 days until the launch of the Kepler mission get excited We ve got countdown and mission info at planetquest jpl nasa gov,LRT
And the planet train keeps on rolling HD 173416 is about 7x Jup size and has year almost as long as ours at 323 days,LRT
First new planet of 2009 HAT 11 is almost 10 Jup size with toasty day orbit located in the Cygnus constellation,LRT
HD 181433 on the other hand is just over half Jupiter mass and takes just about Earth years to make its orbit we re up to 333 now,LRT
New planets for the weekend HD 183263 is about Jup mass and take about Earth years to orbit its star,LRT
OGLE2 TR L9 is an even bigger closer roaster 5x Jup size with an even tighter day orbit it no place to spend the holidays,LRT
New planets HAT is hot Jupiter type planet that about 5x Jup size and has quick day orbit time another roaster,LRT
Planet portraits keep rolling in French astronomers managed to snap pic of planet orbiting the bright star beta Pic,LRT
Its sister planet HD 191760 is bit bigger 2x Jup size and orbits farther away 42 AU albeit with pretty eccentric orbit,LRT
And the planet train doesn stop HD 191760 is about the size of Jup and snuggles right up to its host star with an day orbit,LRT
So we re up to 326 planets discovered but more importantly we finally have visible light images of exoplanets Christmas comes early,LRT
And finally HR 8799 orbits at 24 AU and sits about 24 AU from its star Both HD 8799 and Fomalhaut are visible from Earth stars only,LRT
HR 8799 is another big ol gas giant 10x Jup size orbiting its star at distance of 38 AU That makes for 69 000 day long year,LRT
One of the trio of planets that was imaged HR 8799 is about 7x Jupiter size and orbits hefty 68 AU from its host also blue star,LRT
One of the imaged planets Fomalhaut is no bigger than 3x Jupiter size It orbits about 115AU from its host young blue star,LRT
Here another link with better picture of the three planets discovered from the ground,LRT
And it doesn stop there Scientists also managed to snap pics of more from the GROUND wow Check it out,LRT
Hubble has snapped one of the first pictures of an exoplanet Take look here,LRT
BIG exoplanet news coming up later today Stay tuned,LRT
So now we re up to 322 planets These latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky using the radial velocity method,LRT
Now this is big one HD 43848 is 25x Jupiter size and has really odd eccentric orbit Planet or brown dwarf It not clear yet,LRT
HD 143361 is Jupiter mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was Earth orbits from our Sun,LRT
Correction to the last post planet name is HD 48265 Yet another poetic exoplanet moniker,LRT
