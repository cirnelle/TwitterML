SW: My first photo was of a half a field mice. But a year later  we got some of cougars #ssf15,LER,has_no_media
SW: Back then it was almost impossible to see a snow leopard. We saw one on the first day. Then the second.   Then never again for 6 months,LER,has_no_media
AW: Best option is adding in +ve reinforcement  or else kids just won't know what you want when you yell at them #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_media

One of his mates told him the next day "oh don't worry  that was just a black jaguar".   "And that's how Big Cats chose me..." #ssf15,LER,has_no_media

KS: I try to teach students not to argue with someone who is so obviously science illiterate  because they bring the argument down #ssf15,LER,has_no_media
Humans just tense the whole time (self awareness  fear  etc). So don't try this at home plz #ssf15,LER,has_no_media
Myth 3: "Lots of praise spoils your kids". Research has shown that praise can be the most effective form of reinforcement #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_media
One exception  DK says  is that sometimes it is possible to bring forth abilities we didn't know we had access to. #ssf15 #askdrkarl,LER,has_no_media
"It's interesting how much clients can not actually conceptualize space" #sydsciencefest #kindathinky,LER,has_no_media

MP has a plan to get herself into space. This plan is basically...  Big Brother meets interplanetary travel! #ssf15,LER,has_no_media

SW: The protection of rhinos is the only one in India that has a shoot to kill policy #ssf15,LER,has_no_media
Biggest problem for space travel is cost. So  the Big Brother Space Travel idea solves that with reality TV funding.  Seriously.  #ssf15,LER,has_no_media

DC: But dont try walking around naked saying that a scientist said the Naked Ape idea is a myth #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_media
DC: humans are not as naked as we think we are. Our bodies have the same coverage as apes  its just fair and thin #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_media
