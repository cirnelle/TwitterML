And that concludes #MAASSymp on provenance research and due diligence. Thanks tweeters :-) Over to our regular @maasmuseum programming,LER,has_no_media
Sector involvement in Gov process &amp; best practice guidelines is essential says audience member. That's where much knowledge exists #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Varying views across the panel but much caution advised. Systematic response required in sector: Prof Prott #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Panel asked about thoughts on ebay purchases for acquisitions! #MAASSymp #provenance,LER,has_no_media
Tricky  delicate and personal issue is repsonse from the panel. Case by case most likely to shape response. #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Q from floor about proecess re accreditation of valuers. Conflict of interest but key to loans process #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Q&amp;A now at #MAASSymp. 7 incredible speakers to seek information/clarification from. Tweeters  any questions for the panel? #provenance,LER,has_no_media
Hogan talking about what was changed as a result of this experience. Loan agreements now very different. Value issue central #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Works were damaged while on loan  restoration suggested but lender not in agreement. Agreement about value of paintings key. #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Hogan sharing a story about a loan in early 90's. Interesting to note the nature of loan agreements back then. #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Katrina Hogan from @maasmuseum now speaking about collection management issues in due diligence. What can &amp; what does happen. #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Discussion paper out about a national keeping place in Canberra. It's about being proactive about repatriation processes: Poll. #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Geotagging of information about remains is key to ensuring that questions or problems about provenance does not resurface: Poll. #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Visual analysis is key to understanding provenance in studying human remains says Poll. Misattribution has been a problem. #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Ethics is key says Poll. Challenges regarding original location of objects &amp; return to these. #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Poll: repatriation of remains is a starting point for thinking about handling of ancestral remains for many communities #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Poll speaking about the repatriation project at @Sydney_Uni &amp; the ongoing responsibilities of people working w/ ancestral remains #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Matt Poll from @macleaymuseum next to speak. #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
S. Kelly's pres shows that loans across insitutions will be much easier if provenance documentation processes are thorough #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
S. Kelly: the more thorough the provenance around an object the more straight forward the loans process. #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
S. Kelly: Lender and borrower perspectives on loans of objects - complexity in this space. Provenance is embedded through systems #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Sara Kelly next to speak on behalf of the @nma Sara is a Registrar there. #MAASSymp #provenance,LER,has_no_media
Kelly sharing the application process for the Scheme with audience. Documentation appears to be a critical part of process. #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Kelly: @NatGalleryAus first institution to be approved under the new Scheme. Info on Ministry Arts website about what is protected #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Kelly: Aus Gov has dev 2 key policies including Aus Best Practice Guide to Collecting Cultural Material to support the sector #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media

.@jacqui_strecker offering a curatorial perspective on #provenance in cultural insitutions #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Aim to draw a line under the problem &amp; agree on a way forward concludes Vaughan. #provenance #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Vaughan: can't be hurried because we can't get it wrong. Rigor is absolutely critical. New system in place. #MAASSymp #provenance,LER,has_no_media
Collecting of antiquities at the NGA has now been suspended says Vaughan. Dedicated resources allocated. Transperancy key. #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Systems &amp; processes from the past fall far short for today's standards  ethics  requirements says Vaughan #MAASSymp #provenance research,LER,has_no_media
Vaughan: we (cultural institutions) must be proactive and motivated by ethics #MAASSymp #provenance,LER,has_no_media
Photographic evidence of the work's origin was one key prompt for the request to return the object - Vaughan #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Vaughan now addressing the Nat Gallery 'dancing Shiva' issue. #MAASSymp #provenance,LER,has_no_media
American institutions are attempting to address provenance through dedicated resources says Vaughan #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Researching Asian anitquities is extremely problematic for museums &amp; galleries says Vaughan #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Vaughan: many internat issues of provenance in news  pop culture means that cultural institutions are viewed with some hostility #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Vaughan: Aus late to the party regarding provenance &amp; due diligence. Mixed response from the sector about requirements. #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Vaughan: speaking of long  difficult issues eg. Brit Mus &amp; Greece with Parthenon sculptures #MAASSymp #provenance,LER,has_no_media
Vaughan: increasingly something seems amiss. Crisis facing museums &amp; galleries has prompted a gathering - 'Whose Culture?' #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Vaughan: One view - museums &amp; galleries have come under sustained pressure regarding provenance  cultural heritage etc #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Dr Gerard Vaughan  Director @NatGalleryAus about to take the stage #MAASSymp #provenance,LER,has_no_media
More productive to cultivate bilateral relations with source countries. Best way to ensure import of top quality items says Prott #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Prott: 'Willful ignorance' is also an issue with provenance. Need to insist upon origin of objects. Self defeating otherwise #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Dealers  collectors  auction houses need to be held responsible for provenance &amp; due diligence says Prott. #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Sometimes provenance doesn't come in the normal track says Prott. #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Prott: the price paid for an acquisition is an indicator. Very low price suggests trouble. #MAASSymp #provenance,LER,has_no_media
Mosaics from Northern Cyprus - Prott sharing an example. The looting of Cyprus was well known &amp; should have been a red flag #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Object acquisition - standards and tests - about whether purchaser could have reasonably known full information says Prott #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
Checks &amp; tests vary across the world says Prott. Some more strict than others. #MAASSymp #object based #research #provenance,LER,has_no_media
The question of good faith is the challenging issue for many says Prott #MAASSymp #provenance,LER,has_no_media
Tricky and detailed work to gain consistency &amp; uniformity says Prott #MAASSymp #provenance,LER,has_no_media
Prott explaining her experience in provenance research. Constraints &amp; difficulties not well understood. Need uniformity in work #MAASSymp,LER,has_no_media
