real,LRTDays ago Rosetta and celebrated our th year flying in space We started our long journey on almost there now,LRTFarewell who created amp ran this account for the past few years Best of luck from me amp the operations team,LRTMission day Distance to target million km You re now times further from the Sun than am from my destination,LRTBut those are nothing compared to our Mars swingby of just km above the surface,LRTIn we surprised some astronomers who mistook us for an asteroid passing by at km Then in we flew past again at km,LRTOn Friday asteroid DA will pass km above Earth surface In Rosetta and flew past at less than km,LRTDo you ever wonder why going to land on frozen icy comet hundreds of millions of miles from home,LRTaww shucks Thanks celebrating my name day,LRTnice article by explaining questions my instrument COSAC will be trying to answer about the origins of life,LRTRosetta and have reached our peak distance from the Earth million km over times

Happy World Space Week everyone th October,LRTMy mothership Rosetta and have now reached the top of our SpaceRollerCoaster km from the Sun Now we start getting closer,LRTMy orbit around the Sun is like being on roller coaster As get higher slow down then plunge down getting faster amp faster,LRTComet ISON is heading in from the orbit of Jupiter which is roughly where am now It ll be huge just before reach my target wasntme,LRTnew comet has been discovered and looks like it going to be biggie possibly as bright as the moon,LRThave some very special announcements to make in the next few weeks Can reach followers before do SpaceRollercoaster,LRTDid mention ve reached the orbit of Jupiter can see him though he on the other side of the Sun right now,LRTMission day Distance to target million km,LRTgoing to reach the top of my rollercoaster furthest distance from the Sun in early October,LRTMy orbit around the Sun is bit like being on roller coaster As get higher slow down then plunge down getting faster amp faster,LRTHave you ever wondered what it like to fly through deep space Then you might like to watch this video space SDSS,LRThave million km to go That roughly the

available for download enjoy,LRTone of my engineers will be at the student conference this weekend so get your questions ready if you re going,LRTthe Rosetta mission in the news again asteroids aren just boring rocks via,LRTMission day Distance to target million km,LRTwelcome to twitter For all my followers MIDAS is an instrument aboard my mothership Rosetta,LRTcurrently times further from the Earth than the Earth is from the Sun,LRTwas launched years ago today Happy birthday Rosetta,LRTMission day Distance to target million km,LRTNASA just uploaded video about Rosetta and myself to youtube Check it out,LRTIt may be Friday evening but my sims engineers are still hard at work,LRTYou can find nice picture took of Mars on the DLR website please note the image is CIVA Philae ESA,LRTOne of those reasons is that my cameras don point in the same direction So if OSIRIS can see something can,LRTdon take as many pictures as OSIRIS does aboard my mothership Rosetta There are several reasons for this,LRTwould like to clarify am not carrying nuclear or other weapons or Bruce Willis do have drill though,LRTam now just million km from the comet going to land on in and getting closer all the time now,LRTll do it first though Harpooning comet NASA planning to do just that,LRTSad to see the end of Phobos Grunt she had number of instruments and teams closely related to my own We were cousins in way,LRTHappy Friday the th Earthlings Especially astronomy teacher my th follower Please say hi to your students for me,LRTlots of my scientists are congregating in the

Model,LRTISIC International Space Innovation Centre,LRTIf Concorde was still flying and went in straight line through the Sun and could fly in space it would need over years to reach me,LRTcurrently on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth almost million km or million miles away PhilaeThursday,LRTyears ago today my mothership and were wrongly identified as Earth threatening asteroid Today real roid flies past safely,LRTMy distance from the Earth doesn just increase because we re not traveling in straight lines Sometimes the Earth catches up little,LRTComet tails point away from the Sun because they re not caused by movement but by the solar wind radiation pressure,LRTWhen operating each Tx unit is switched on hourly alternately by hardware mechanism to ensure they WILL be turned on,LRTBeing able to communicate with the Rosetta orbiter is vital to my mission So have transmitters and receivers PhilaeThursday,LRTgoing to land on comet but robot Landing humans on an asteroid will be much harder via,LRTComets are one of the few things you can shoot with harpoon and then expect people to say Great Shoot it again PhilaeThursday,LRTbe chasin an

take photo though Cologne Germany,LRTSubsystem is CDMS my flight computer It full of redundant systems to be fault tolerant and runs unique OS PhilaeThursday,LRTMy anchoring subsystem has harpoons to hold me down securely on the comet surface after landing PhilaeThursday,LRTMy ADS thruster can also give me small push towards the comet during descent reducing the descent time PhilaeThursday,LRTThis is because the comet is so small its gravity is very weak don want to bounce off into space back after landing PhilaeThursday,LRTUnlike landing on planet where thrusters may be used to slow down lander my thruster will push me down ONTO the comet PhilaeThursday,LRTThe first of my subsystems alphabetically is the Active Descent System or ADS which has Nitrogen gas thruster PhilaeThursday,LRTof my subsystems were built using advanced technology from crashed alien spacecraft Yes even spacecraft enjoy aprilfools day,LRThave subsystems and am carrying experiment

PhilaeThursday,LRTCongrats to the Stardust NExT team on their flyby of comet Tempel,LRTThe distance between me and the Earth is actually decreasing at the moment can anybody guess why,LRTmy clever science team are still busy analyzing possible descents for me at the comet can safely land at up to km PhilaeThursday,LRTupdate is little late this week sorry,LRTHappy Birthday to my Project Manager Stephan Ulamec PhilaeThursday,LRTRosetta is performing series of thruster burns tweaking our course to the comet Read more at PhilaeThursday,LRTcan talk to my ground controllers directly Rosetta passes my messages to Earth with its powerful antenna vice versa PhilaeThursday,LRTThe check out is over have started my long Hibernation Phase on DOY Dec at UTC zzzzzzzz,LRTlanded safely Well not really but the Separation Descent Landing test went perfectly Comet here come,LRTcheckout is going well ve had new version of my flight software uploaded and am now preparing to rehearse the

the final checkout of my units and systems before hibernation until,LRTMy ground engineers are busy preparing for PC the last chance to checkout my systems and instruments until PhilaeThursday,LRTcontinued The change came when my launch was delayed by year and my planned route to Wirtanen became impossible PhilaeThursday,LRTAlthough am flying towards comet Churyumov Gerasimenko was originally designed to land on comet Wirtanen PhilaeThursday,LRTam being carried by the Rosetta probe My name comes from temple in Egypt closely associated with the Rosetta stone

Moon Mars,LRTCould we ever recycle space junk Nicole MCA,LRTspace treaties,LRTOne aspect is to keep an eye on activities in orbit using radars and telescopes the other is to monitor UK responsibilities under,LRTWhat do you do on daily basis in your job Sam Fitzpatrick MCA,LRTif it was required,LRTWe use telescopes which allow us to identify all of the big asteroids many years in advance so enabling us to mount deflection mission,LRTHow do you detect asteroids if they are about to hit Earth Keira Davis St Leonard of,LRTWhat are the chances of satellite or piece of space junk falling on my head Lunera Kaschif MCA,LRTWe are now LIVE with our Chief Engineer Prof Richard Crowther Send us your on NEO space security and space debris junk now wswq amp,LRTLess than minutes

fantastic weekend Between BST today our Chief Engineer Prof Richard Crowther,LRTWe re back on Monday with Prof Richard Crowther Chief Engineer who deals with Space Security and Near Earth Objects wswq amp,LRTThat it for todays Tweet the Expert session Thanks for answering all those Thanks to all our followers for asking too,LRTrd tweet the expert session day with Head of Robotic Exploration Bus Dev Astrium Space exploration ready BST,LRTThanks again It was great session,LRTNow that should just about wrap up our Tweet the expert session Big thank you to our expert Thanks for sending in your,LRTinterested in the psychological effects of space travel What preparation tests are used to assess them,LRTSession of our Tweet the expert series has begun UK ESA astronaut is here to answer your for the next hr wswq amp,LRTnew wave of space engineers,LRTImage of the Day Geostationary disco,LRTPhew That hour went quickly Thanks for all your questions and don forget is with us tomorrow at BST wswq amp,LRTBut our telescopes and instruments are getting better all the time,LRTMost planets found around other stars so far are bigger than the Earth because they re easier to detect,LRTHave you found any planets that are similar to Earth Chanez Amaduche MCA,LRTto distort space time But it always mistake to rule anything out and it great that people are investigating such new ideas,LRTdon know very much about it understand that it has some theoretical basis but it would require enormous amounts of energy,LRTDo you place any credence in Miguel Alcubierre warp drive theory,LRTYoung stars old stars and the famous Orion nebula where new stars are being born,LRTOrion the Hunter because it big and spectacular and it has lots of interesting things,LRTWhat is your favorite constellation Henry Barlow MCA wswq amp,LRTIf they happen to look good that nice bonus When it comes to spaceships in science fiction anything goes,LRTIn the case of real spaceships function is much more important than style and the design is purely practical,LRTWhere does the inspiration for spaceship designs come from,LRTIt easier and quite feasible technically to do it wswq amp,LRTYes believe that men have been to the Moon find it much harder to believe that such an enormous conspiracy could be successful,LRTDo you believe that man really has walked on the moon or was it conspiracy Could we go to mars,LRTWe are top of the league We take every game as it comes If we get promoted then next year we will crush the puny Tynesiders,LRTWhat are the chances of Cardiff City being promoted this year,LRTThe pictures are great and it in these filaments that new stars are born wswq amp,LRTThe amazing filaments of gas and dust in our galaxy that the Herschel Space Observatory has found,LRTWhat the most fascinating thing you ve seen in space Ramez Rubbani MCA wswq amp,LRTBut most of the energy comes from burning hydrogen which is very clean fuel it just forms water,LRTNot enormous few tens of tons of CO for launch and some pollutants which disperse rapidly,LRTWhat the quantity of green house gases and air pollution produced in launch to ISS,LRTDifferent wavelengths tell us different things,LRTWe look at the light emitted by stars planets and galaxies not just light we can see with our eyes but also light at other wavelengths,LRTHow do you know lots of things about the universe Elliot Cardno St Leonard of wswq amp,LRTIt will be far too hot for life to exist Earth But it won happen for about five billion years,LRTThe Sun will expand rather than explode becoming red giant star and engulfing the Earth in its atmosphere,LRTIs it true that the world will end by the sun exploding When might this happen wswq amp,LRTIt much easier to work at lower frequencies wswq amp,LRTTHz radiation is strongly absorbed by water vapour in the atmosphere and so is not suitable for ground orbit communication,LRTWhether or not THz communication from LEO to ground is achievable at reasonable power levels,LRTwhich still remains the best film about the universe and our place in it,LRTfirst became fascinated by space through the moon landings and the film Space Odyssey,LRTHow did you become interested in Astronomy Stephen MCA wswq amp,LRTDark Fluid theory is very speculative we can say if it has any validity let alone any uses,LRTWe have no idea about how to travel faster in space without using known physics,LRTCould dark fluid theory lead to faster space travel or is energy mass involved too great for us to make use of it,LRTWe have batch of questions that you have mailed in so we ll start off with those If you have more questions tweet them at us wswq amp,LRTWelcome to our Tweet the Expert Hope you ve got your questions ready

stars Read story in rhyme about girl on planet hunt,LRTAlso WASP which has the distinction of being the first dying planet found it got mil yrs before SMACK right into its star,LRTMeanwhile CoRoT has discovered the first confirmed terrestrial exoplanet It one of two super Earth size planets that orbit the star,LRTOk back and the planet news has piled up For starters cross WASP off the exoplanet list looks like it actually binary star,LRTWild week for exoplanets first there was the planet train wreck discovered by Spitzer,LRTIn this case is roasting hot Jupiter with day orbit and is portly xJupiter mass planet with super eccentric orbit,LRTHAT and have people pretty excited it the first time multi planet system with one transiting planet has been discovered,LRTAnother new one HD is little bit smaller Jup masses and has pretty eccentric egg shaped orbit around its star,LRTNew planets HD is whopping Jupiter mass planet with year about days longer than Earth Massive,LRTInterviewed Greg Laughlin about planet that might serve as an extra gas tank that ll reignite its star it the top story on PlanetQuest,LRTAnybody checked out Greg Laughlin blog at oklo org It dope well written cool photos and lots of stuff to ponder,LRTAlso had some folks announce that they observed the phases of an exoplanet as it orbited in front of and then behind its host star whoa,LRTPlanetQuest isn dead We ve had few new planet additions and some interesting finds like an exoplanet in Andromeda maybe,LRTIt been quiet lately but here some big news astronomers find planets using astrometry for the first time way cool,LRTProps to everyone who came to the JPL Open House Esp the RoboDome line survivors little video from inside the dome,LRTFun fact HAT transit was also detected by an amateur astronomer in Portugal lots of people getting in on the planet hunt,LRTNew planet HAT is sub Saturn size planet orbiting in scorching day orbit,LRTIf you re in SoCal this weekend come check out the free JPL open house See cool stuff talk to scientists visit the legendary ROBODOME,LRTThat not all HD is gas giant planet with an eccentric orbit that takes it as close as Mercury to our sun and farther than Mars,LRTReply The waterworld theory is based on its orbit and models that predict lots of ice water on its surface just guess for now,LRTSo to sum up Gliese Kamino maybe Gliese Mustafar maybe Confused handy reference,LRTThe same team has also found that sister planet Gliese may actually be in its star habitable zone and could be an ocean planet,LRTThis just in Gliese is just the size of the Earth and is the smallest exoplanet yet discovered It could possibly terrestrial,LRTKepler first light images are up WOOT Check em out Let hope plenty of Earths are hiding in that starfield,LRTKepler will start collecting scientific data in few weeks so far so good,LRTThe Kepler dust cover was ejected successfully Scientists now know what kind of background

ejected in about an hour at the latest,LRTGet stoked for hours of Astronomy Some cool stuff like Kepler and Spitzer webcasts or the chance get to control remote telescope,LRTThe other new planet is also in constellation Draco HD is hefty Jupiter size gas giant with an day orbit,LRTWell it been pretty quiet lately but finally we have some new planets Dra is gas giant orbiting sun size star at about AU,LRTKepler has launched Right on Everything seems to be going well so far nearly minutes into the flight,LRTThis planet was teased out of previously existing radial velocity data for HD using Bayesian analysis,LRTGas giant HD is little smaller than Jupiter with pretty eccentric orbit that averages about AU from its host star,LRTPlanet Alert Not much info on CoRoT Exo yet but it appears to be Hot Jupiter type with very close day orbit around its star,LRTInterestingly they have mean motion resonance meaning that over the same amount of time one planet makes orbits the other,LRTCouple new planets announced today HD and are gas giants that orbit at about and AU respectively eccentric orbits too,LRTDespite what you may have read the new planet is NOT confirmed to be the smallest in mass discovered it about times Earth mass,LRTHot new planet COROT Exo is the first transiting super Earth and maybe the first terrestrial planet found It about Earth size,LRTNew Super Earth discovered HD is about the size of Earth but with tiny day orbit around its star Bring the sunblock,LRTScientists using Spitzer have just seen an exoplanet with wild orbit heat up over in just over six hours Deets,LRTQuestions about exoplanets Bring em on,LRTScientists estimate the size of MOA BLG Lb to be about Earth masses still pretty small but not quite as much as was reported,LRTHeads up the Earth size planet reported yesterday was false alarm some confusion between couple of reports,LRTKepler going to watch the sky for few years looking for transiting exoplanets and letting us know just how many Earths might be nearby,LRTJust days until the launch of the Kepler mission get excited We ve got countdown and mission info at planetquest jpl nasa gov,LRTAnd the planet train keeps on rolling HD is about Jup size and has year almost as long as ours at days,LRTFirst new planet of HAT is almost Jup size with toasty day orbit located in the Cygnus constellation,LRTHD on the other hand is just over half Jupiter mass and takes just about Earth years to make its orbit we re up to now,LRTNew planets for the weekend HD is about Jup mass and take about Earth years to orbit its star,LRTOGLE TR is an even bigger closer roaster Jup size with an even tighter day orbit it no place to spend the holidays,LRTNew planets HAT is hot Jupiter type planet that about Jup size and has quick day orbit time another roaster,LRTPlanet portraits keep rolling in French astronomers managed to snap pic of planet orbiting the bright star beta Pic,LRTIts sister planet HD is bit bigger Jup size and orbits farther away AU albeit with pretty eccentric orbit,LRTAnd the planet train doesn stop HD is about the size of Jup and snuggles right up to its host star with an day orbit,LRTSo we re up to planets discovered but more importantly we finally have visible light images of exoplanets Christmas comes early,LRTAnd finally HR orbits at AU and sits about AU from its star Both HD and Fomalhaut are visible from Earth stars only,LRTHR is another big ol gas giant Jup size orbiting its star at distance of AU That makes for day long year,LRTOne of the trio of planets that was imaged HR is about Jupiter size and orbits hefty AU from its host also blue star,LRTOne of the imaged planets Fomalhaut is no bigger than Jupiter size It orbits about AU from its host young blue star,LRTHere another link with better picture of the three planets discovered from the ground,LRTAnd it doesn stop there Scientists also managed to snap pics of more from the GROUND wow Check it out,LRTHubble has snapped one of the first pictures of an exoplanet Take look here,LRTBIG exoplanet news coming up later today Stay tuned,LRTSo now we re up to planets These latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky using the radial velocity method,LRTNow this is big one HD is Jupiter size and has really odd eccentric orbit Planet or brown dwarf It not clear yet,LRTHD is Jupiter mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was Earth orbits from our Sun,LRTCorrection to the last post planet name is HD Yet another poetic exoplanet moniker,LRTHalloween planets HD is gas giant about the size of Jupiter with an orbit about as far out from its star as Mars is,LRTThat makes new planets discovered and brings our planet count to Get the fine details on these cool new worlds at,LRTHD is gas giant with super eccentric orbit if it orbited our sun it would swing from closer than Mercury to farther than Mars,LRTHD is massive planet the size of Jupiter It has very eccentric orbit that takes it days to complete,LRTHD is the size of Jupiter with an orbit of days around star just hotter than our sun about as long as Mars year,LRTBD is big ol Jupiter size planet with pretty eccentric day orbit around its small star,LRTHD is also in the constellation Scorpio is the size of Jupiter and is bit further from its star than Earth is at AU,LRTLots of new planets to announce HD is almost the size of Jupiter and orbits about half an AU from sunlike star,LRTLupus TR is back on the list new evidence shows it planet This is Jupiter size world that only AU from its star Hot,LRTLooks like Lupus TR might actually be part of multiple star and not actually planet so we re dropping it from the count for now,LRTWeird COROT exo is the size of Jupiter but its mass Scientists aren yet sure just what it actually is Link,LRTLooks like the HAT and WASP teams found the same planet at the same time So now it called HAT WASP and the count is back to,LRTThis actually just refers to extrasolar planets not in our own solar system good question,LRTFor those keeping score this brings us up to planets discovered and multi planet solar systems so far it busy neighborhood,LRTAnd HD is more than the size of Jupiter and orbits its star about as far away as Mars is from our sun,LRTLooks like today triple play for new planets HD is just about the size of Jupiter and orbits at abou AU from its star,LRTNew planet added today CT Cha crams Jup masses into planet just times as big and orbiting AU possibly brown dwarf,LRTMOA BLG was discovered using gravitational lensing an exotic way to hunt for planets using light bent by the gravity from stars,LRTNew planet for Talk Like Pirate Day Not much info yet

has announced the Carl Sagan Fellowships in Exoplanet Exploration The stipend will be year to selected postdocs,LRTRemember to see the stats for any of these planets just visit and type in the name of the planet,LRTTW Hydrae has been dropped from the atlas due to findings that it might have been detection of stellar spots instead,LRTAnd one more HD which is about the size of Jupiter AU from its star which is just about Sun size Big planet,LRTHD was also announced it times the size of Jupiter and orbits about AU from its star which is the size of the sun,LRTAt long last we have some new planet updates GJ is about half the size of Jupiter and orbits AU from its tiny host star,LRTNew story on planetquest jpl nasa gov Backyard planet hunting Amateur astronomers join the exoplanet

will,LRTNot yet Haven seen it Too much to just now plan on it tho Bill an old pal,LRTHmmm Enceladus Then move to Uranus Neptune orbiter We need to sit and watch those planets not just fly by,LRTTook too long ran hugely over budget but if it works no one will care Same thing happened to Hubble,LRTGeologist love rocks That why fond of meteorites Best of both worlds So to speak,LRTIf had to the Moon Short trip less likely to fry from solar radiation Also monolith hunts,LRTsay Earth It not just methane but esters in the gas and we re good at making those biologically,LRTUnclear

the informal names being used for dark spots suggested by public campaign organized by,HRTguess Tweet takes the place of the traditional phone call these days,HRTAtmospheric science result,HRTCathy Olkin From the ground we knew there were lot of different colors on Pluto but we never imagined anything like this,HRTHere is the MVIC color data hope pics will make it online soon Charon pole is red,HRTThe not planets all those round worlds we ve visited to scale,HRTthink that the most dangerous possible thing to say about Pluto flyby that with it we re somehow done with the solar system We re not,HRTOh this don agree with How about the whole rest of the Kuiper belt Eris Makemake Haumea Sedna Orcus,HRTBonnie Buratti We have been monitoring from Earth what we now know is the heart on Pluto for years,HRTBagenal Pluto looked remarkably like Mars Much better than Mars though,HRTFran Bagenal says it unlikely New Horizons will reach interstellar space it going slower than Voyagers,HRTJust had an opportunity to congratulate Marc Buie on the quality of his pre New Horizons Hubble maps of Pluto,HRTRosetta looked at Pluto too,HRTNew Horizons best look at Pluto before close approach,HRTBowman We were seconds early Stern Our nav predicts came out to km closer to Pluto than aimpoint Well within spec PlutoFlyby,HRTRight now all images are being returned with JPEG like lossy compression We will get lossless ones eventually,HRTStern To my eye these pictures show younger surface on Pluto and much older and more battered surface on Charon PlutoFlyby,HRTGrunsfeld to Bowman What is the actual data rate think it lower than Bowman Yeah we wish it was PlutoFlyby,HRTasked if the new image showed evidence of hazes or clouds Stern replied he looked and hadn seen those or plumes yet,HRTXKCD What if What if New Horizons hit my car,HRTThere is lot of applause happening but it feels premature until we hear from New Horizons again,HRTSince it FAQ It will be hours until we hear from New Horizons because spacecraft is too busy scienceing to talk to us right now,HRTPress briefing coming up momentarily But still hours until we find out whether New Horizons survived flyby or not,HRTClosest approach PlutoFlyby,HRTThey are playing The Final Countdown,HRTThis is happening outside the press room and off NASA TV and not sure why,HRTMy first impressions of

scratch,HRTGrunsfeld Pluto is capstone of our solar system exploration and also it opening up new realm,HRTStern explains color data is much more expensive in terms of bits to get it to the ground which is why more LORRI pics have come down,HRTStern We tested techniques we used to determine Pluto diameter on Charon and got the right answer radius km,HRTunderstand you have to put miles on graphics for Americans but for love of Pete why can you also put metric measurements,HRTStern We detected escaping nitrogen before expected Either escaping faster than we thought or mechanism is different than thought,HRTStern Pluto radius is km It settles the debate about the largest object in the Kuiper belt,HRTPSA will not respond to any questions comments about Pluto planetary status
