ago,LRTScheduled access to the LHC tunnel is on the cards for today then back to commissioning CERN,LRTThere was press conference earlier in the day taking stock of what happened over the weekend CERN LHC,LRTThat was good night for the LHC with periods of quiet beam Next step same again for the other beam,LRTThanks for following us and for all the support We ll keep you posted if anything interesting happens CERN LHC,LRTThis has been great hours for the LHC Now the systems commissioning begins so we ll be tweeting less often for while CERN LHC,LRTWelcome back beam This is the clockwise direction Point ALICE experiment gt gt gt CMS gt gt gt LHCb gt Point ATLAS Its circulating,LRTMachine ready for injection of beam the clockwise beam CERN LHC,LRTYes the trick is the concentration of energy in tiny tiny tiny tiny particles Now let move to step particles enter the LHC CERN LHC,LRTALICE experiment records splashes as well CERN LHC,LRTBack to GeV the extraction energy from SPS Crushing nut easily involves more than GeV of your energy So where is the trick CERN LHC,LRTLive update on restart of beams the LHC is preparing for injection from the SPS CERN LHC,LRTstep protons are sent to SPS the last circle before the LHC few turns to increase the energy up to GeV Do you know how much is it,LRTrd step protons are sent to circular accelerators PSB and PS it were bunches are prepared The energy increases And then CERN LHC,LRTIn reply to some tweets there is no issue with any single dipole at LHC Teams are simply improving the calibration of the protection system,LRTnd step protons are accelerated in LINAC linear accelerator Their energy starts to increase And then CERN LHC,LRTSome info about how we make beams for the LHC protons are produced by stripping electrons from hydrogen atoms This is easy Then CERN LHC,LRTit in Geneva operators are checking various parameters in the injection chain and the LHC CERN LHC,LRTHello everybody this is Antonella tweeting from the CERN CCC The situation is calm here beams are not expected before pm CERN LHC,LRTArnaud is going to sleep now and says goodbye Antonella will take over keeping in touch with you guys CERN LHC,LRTSome settings are being done Stay tuned And be ready for new beams of protons circulating at almost the speed of light CERN LHC,LRTJoking We will go asap to circulating beam again to do some measurements refine and check things CERN LHC,LRTMeeting just finished Do you want to know what is happening CERN LHC,LRTAM meeting is starting CERN LHC,LRTThe night team is gone to sleep Thanks to them The new team is taking over Meeting at AM to discuss the next step CERN LHC,LRTThank you all for the good wishes and congratulations messages new foggy day is starting at CERN but an exciting one CERN LHC,LRTLHC prepares for magnet precycle No beam at least until AM Some settings also to do before next steps Be patient Stay tuned CERN,LRTBuzz The whole world is following LHC news CERN LHC,LRTThis is just quiet here Everything runs smoothly CERN LHC,LRTSplashes of particles will help the experiments to calibrate their detectors in view of collisions CERN LHC,LRTWant better idea of what is splash of particles See pictures from ATLAS and CMS CERN LHC,LRTDuring night ATLAS and LHCb experiments recorded splashes of particles LHC is

to point CMS experiment LHC CERN,LRTWelcome beam One sector done LHC CERN,LRTCavities are switched on We will wait for good beam quality before attempting to capture it,LRTDecision was made to first capture beam and then go for injection of beam To do so we will soon switch on the cavities,LRTTeams are working to improve beam quality before injecting in the anticlockwise direction Beam has made several turns around the LHC,LRTBeam is at point two sectors to go,LRTBeam has just arrived at Point just three more sectors to go,LRTLook at the first photographs from the CERN Control

video,LRTscio has begun,LRTIn Raleigh ready for scio to begin in force tomorrow,LRTTHIS Watching recaps from the and episodes of at the same time,LRTcannot wait for Scio North Carolina here come,LRTabout to be interviewed on Atlanta listen live here,LRTTo be clear my videos won be changing in appearance style because of editing software switch It like switching from Canon to Nikon,LRTAnd the AfterEffects integration within Premiere is kind of ridiculous,LRTIn general Premiere seems pretty awesome There ve been few hiccups and bumps along the way still ironing those things out,LRTTo those wondering where the next MinutePhysics episode is have been making it with new editing software Premiere so it going slow,LRTPlaying around with speech analysis tools in Adobe Premiere AM FLOORED,LRTHurrah My adobe premiere question was solved by the pro tip guru Sam of Solution upgrade to CS and use adjustment layer,LRTRight now posterize is applied first and speed second GAH,LRTCalling all adobe premiere experts want to speed clip up then posterize time so the spedup clip plays at fps,LRTAlso this next video might be the first time try to make MinutePhysics using Adobe Premiere yikes,LRTWhat everyday phenomena are described by the reciprocal function,LRTSomeone made youtuber themed holiday cookies,LRTFinally got plane tickets to scio and can wait,LRTanyone have problems with the latest MinutePhysics video showing up in your feeds email notifications,LRTFinishing up video so can pack to go home to MN,LRTWow just watched and make US nordic ski history Congrats ladies,LRTWatching and rock at the quebec world cup,LRTJammin on Red Haired Boy on the mandolin,LRTWhat is the perfect gift for scientist An tshirt,LRTNew MinuteMandolin song,LRTla if you re an undecided voter email me about your undecidedness and if you want include your sparksflyup at gmail,LRTSomebody did my tutorial and made pretty sweet video too,LRTESA Opening Plenary Curating Conversation about Ecology Relevance to Earth Future ESAPL,LRTGoing to ESA Collaborate and share your blog posts on Field Reports blog,LRTReady to read for PLOS sciwed AMA James Hansen Start here climatescience,LRTThanks amp participants for busy AMA James Hansen will bring more ecology to PLOS Science Weds on,LRTUpdated for ESA the latest ecology climatescience research articles TKS to curator,LRTUpdated for ESA the latest ecology climatescience research articles TKS to curator,LRTUpdated for ESA the latest ecology climatescience research articles TKS to curator,LRTUpdated for ESA the latest ecology climatescience research articles TKS to curator,LRTAMA There are quite few lines of evidence that mortality events are in frequency amp possibly severity,LRTCatch up on today PLOS Science Wed AMA here,LRTAMA Are mass die offs actually getting worse more frequent or larger in scale in recent decades years,LRTAMA In this case the invertebrates died very rapidly amp their death wouldn have been great warning system,LRTAMA What long term effects will this have on the surrounding ecosystems Is the problem improving stable or worsening,LRTAMA Quite few marine scientists work shipping industry to harmful practices amp sustainable ones,LRTAMA How do people in marineecology view the shipping industry amp its impact on ocean habitats,LRTAMA Interestingly no algae grew where we lost massive urchin populations,LRTAMA It not the primary cause of the die off but more research is needed to learn the effects of the warm blob,LRTAMA Is higher temps in the Pacific Ocean the primary cause of the die offs,LRTAMA Urchins are known to go through boom and bust cycles but this is the largest die off of this species,LRTAMA There are very effective ways to coastal pollution that algal blooms but some may still occur,LRTAMA Our group didn detect any effects on fish at all,LRTAMA How will this die off affect consumable fish What about shellfish,LRTAMA To me the concern is that we preserve the amazing biodiversity of the earth,LRTAMA It important to note we have no guarantee that US west coast native oysters will be fine That still an area of ongoing research,LRTAMA IMO fixing these probs requires lot of public outcry amp consistent involvement by citizens,LRTAMA What can do to help prevent the extinction of these sea species along the Pacific coast,LRTAMA by Algal growth models could be really useful avenue for future research,LRTAMA There are more cases of low invertebrate kills than toxicity but in this case oxygen isn the cause,LRTAMA by agree it unlikely the event we describe is directly related to the sea star wasting disease,LRTPlease do,LRTAMA Do these algal blooms kill all sea life amp does the algal blooms in prt of the ecosystem create cascade,LRTThx for helping us spread the word abt today PLOS Science Weds ecology ESA,LRTAMA If harmful human practices stopped would most fish pops to good levels quickly or would it take long time,LRTAMA Is there any data on the pre collapse genetic diversity of the effected populations ecology,LRTAMA Is there anything we can actually do to reverse this Not just limit the harm but actively turn this back,LRTAMA Could the die offs be related to the low levels of dissolved oxygen that follow large algal blooms,LRTAMA the only immediate thing both these areas seem to have in common is higher sea temperature anomalies,LRTPreview this wk PLOS Science Wed AMA on ESA,LRTThank you to Sten Vermund amp all our AMA participants See you next week on PLOS Science Weds,LRTAMA WHO Code of Practice is most symbolic effort to SSA health worker retention but is nonbinding amp ineffective,LRTAMA What are some ways govts in SSA are incentivizing physicians to practice med in their countries of origin,LRTAMA Yes by selecting students from rural areas amp nurturing their career primary care many return home to work,LRTAMA Would picking students stronger connections to home amp aren necessarily looking for the biggest paycheck help this problem,LRTAMA The nations that have done better to keep their professionals had improved infrastructures better health staffing amp quality control,LRTAMA Yes MEPI CONSAMS SACORE partnerships like the universities partnering Rwanda,LRTAMA Are there efforts to strengthen med programs in SSA to incentivize potential drs to stay amp complete their medical training at home,LRTAMA The US doesn train enough physicians to meet its needs amp has always relied on migration from abroad,LRTAMA Stopping the migration of skilled health workers from SSA may not be possible but it is definitely feasible,LRTAMA look at the code amp don see how it could have helped what going to stop someone qualified from seeking higher pay abroad,LRTAMA Incentivizing early career physicians to stay and practice in SSA should be the focus,LRTAMA What can be done by govts on both sides to encourage SSA physicians to practice in their home countries,LRTLIVE PLOS Science Wed how migration of African health workers impacts global health MT,LRTAMA Most SSA migrant physicians practicing in the US were recruited here as residents then as licensed physicians,LRTAMA When you say recruited do you mean US companies hospitals are actively depriving SSA of medical care,LRTAMA Conditions of service is equally amp maybe more important as factor of migration than wage differential,LRTAMA What the avg salary compensation difference between physician practicing in SSA country and one who has emigrated to the US,LRTFor more BG on today PLOS Science Wed on the African health worker brain drain AMA,LRTAMA What can be done by governments on both sides to encourage SSA physicians to practice in their home countries,LRTWe re communicating our research Wed globalhealth AMA amET Tweetchat epig AMET scicomm,LRTCan the brain drain of doctors from Africa to US be stemmed How why AMA

we ll see you next week,LRTAMA Students are developing method to find new RNA sequences that can bind to different metabolic products,LRTHello ESA ESA from the Early Career Ecology Section by,LRTAMA Do you think it would feasible to use high throughput screening to discover new riboswitches,LRTAMA Do you have the sequence of the entire genome including plasmids of each colony strain you produce,LRTAMA Optimal does not nec mean maximal goal is to find the best variant for production of the metabolite,LRTAMA The best combination was no chaperone low plasmid copy number strong promter strong RBS,LRTAMA What was the mechanism that the bacteria used to increase fitness syntheticbiology,LRTAMA What advantages amp disadvantages does this have compared conventional methods of genetic engineering,LRTAMA It is conceivable that we could apply Programmed Evolution to bees or other eukaryotic organisms,LRTAMA Could we engineer bees that are resistant to disease and pesticides,LRTAMA Hard to anticipate the answers coli comes up when asked the optimal way to carry out desired metabolism,LRTPLOS Science Wednesday AMA is now live Ask your syntheticbiology qs here,LRTAMA It impossible to model coli metabolism on computer More at,LRTAMA Could the problem you are solving potentially also be solved via software on computer,LRTAMA They defined fitness as optimal production of the product gt led to optimal growth amp more product synthesis,LRTAMA How do you ensure that the introduced pathways are maintained not thrown out and even optimized,LRTAMA Its cheaper to buy directly Our research was testing if Programmed Evolution could work The answer is yes,LRTAMA If the DNA sequence isn patented would it be possible to produce moon shine like asthma medication,LRTAMA Will this technology have any application to field such as material engineering,LRTDr Todd Eckdahl amp colleagues are taking your qs about syntheticbiology in today AMA live at pm ET,LRTAMA We hope our work will lead to cheaper production of desired products cleaning up toxins,LRTAMA What is the end goal of your research say years from now syntheticbiology,LRTAMA Programmed evolution provided set of possible genetic combos amp the bacteria determined which was optimal,LRTAMA survival is linked to expression of metabolic pathway does it the likelihood of the desired evolution,LRTAMA We did not see cells develop TetR outside the Programmed Evolution,LRTAMA What have you learned about the unpredictability of evolution,LRTAMA Do you have any ethical dilemmas interfering with the natural order of development How do you solve them,LRTGreat Qs for today AMA How does this relate to evolution in larger organisms such as working ear Ask yrs,LRTThank you for everyone who participated in today AMA We ll see you next week on PLOS Science Weds,LRTAMA We wouldn be surprised at all to find this capacity in other species as well,LRTAMA Do the vocalizations of other animals need to be studied to find evidence of phonemic capacities,LRTJust mins left in today AMA,LRTAMA We aim to better understand the internal structure of other call types in the chestnut crowned babbler,LRTAMA Where do you aim to go with this research in the future,LRTAMA Do you think the environment adds noticeable element to which linguistical tools can be used between birds,LRTAMA We will begin investigating how each of these sounds are perceived with systematic playback experiments,LRTAMA This species has calls that are easy to quantify analyse amp play back in experiments,LRTAMA What specifically attracted you to this species of birds,LRTAMA Yes we know that there is some consistent variation in babbler calls across different populations,LRTAMA Have birds of the same species exhibited differences in calls akin to what one might regard as an accent,LRTEverything you ever wanted to ask know abt how birds and other species form speech right now on,LRTAMA Do our closest living relatives have something similar to what the babblers do,LRTPLOS pleased to be sponsoring Career Ecologists Section for ESA Thanks,LRTInviting paleontologists to today PLOS Science Wed on the Biology of Bird Sounds File in Birds dinosaurs,LRTAMA Is this related to birds understanding of rhythm Or perhaps their evolution of the ability to do so,LRTJust mins

journalists We need those firewall policies WCSJ,LRTalso references and says older groups like becoming more sure footed WCSJ,LRTSomething similar may be happening at now building capacity to do deep work WCSJ,LRTSome formerly cut rate places are now raising their game doing good journalism says referring to WCSJ,LRTThere at least three hopeful responses underway None are ideal But they giving us good digital journalism WCSJ,LRTrd problem with audience atomization is it creates opportunities for mischief by special interest groups WCSJ,LRTCross cultural conversations are being stifled by this atomization of interest WCSJ,LRTBut even as we are converging in multimedia tools we are diverging in our content Easy to build information bubble WCSJ,LRTIt time when they can tell more transparent vivid contextual stories WCSJ,LRTIncreasingly think the same media convergence will be occurring all over the world WCSJ,LRTIt all sounds pretty grim and yet there are reasons not to lose hope WCSJ,LRTThe emergence of the Internet only made us more confident we thought we knew what tank man wanted WCSJ,LRTremembers the incident at Tiananmen Square We know about it because there were journalists there WCSJ,LRTnotes that he knows the US best and apologizes for any bias in the talk WCSJ,LRTwants to step back and look at the big picture How did we get here Where are we going WCSJ,LRTNow hearing talk at WCSJ Squee Someday ll get brave enough to introduce myself,LRTNow final statement fill voids and feed curiosity Grow your own voice WCSJ,LRTMarie Pier Elie never be satisfied Keep digging WCSJ,LRTShow people what you are doing as you do it with Instagram etc get people excited before story comes out WCSJ,LRTSometimes words aren enough comics can be powerful media says WCSJ,LRTdid piece on einsteins visit to Argentina to promote it he tweeted like he was at the visit in WCSJ,LRThas strategies using fiction to capture attention and spark imagination WCSJ,LRTsays you have to punch through the pseudoscience How do you get through the noise WCSJ have to be interesting,LRTtalks about blending science and sci fi Like this WCSJ,LRTNow on strategies for digital storytelling WCSJ,LRTMarie tells the story of one camera crew that tried to manufacture fight between scientists Yikes WCSJ,LRTHighlight the human element to help viewers feel their motivations But again it rigor Marie says WCSJ,LRTMany scientists do much better when they think the camera is off Marie says Basic questions help too WCSJ,LRTHow do you find interviewees who are both knowledgable and charismatic Marie says pretty rare Knowledgeability is mandatory WCSJ,LRTWe only have to find what is sexy in science It not about forcing sexy on top of science says Marie WCSJ,LRTMarie says what you decide not to tell if just as important as what you decide to tell Do pruning for the relevant information WCSJ,LRTBut entertainment without rigor is even worse WCSJ how do you build narrative for audience with limited attention span,LRTNOW Marie Pier Elie Notes that rigor without any entertainment is no good in TV WCSJ,LRTEmilie says she was writing about cosmic rays and an observatory Turns out observatory was too small WCSJ,LRTOh sorry Current comments are from Emilie Martin their name plaques are mixed up WCSJ,LRTScientist complained there was too much human factor and not enough science WCSJ,LRTShe ended up writing about how people lived at the research station who they were etc WCSJ the scientist hated it,LRTMarie Piere Elie says she went to see scientists finding auroras but had no luck with the science WCSJ,LRTNow in entertainment and rigor can they coexist WCSJ,LRTLunch at WCSJ Lovely presentation,LRTlooks to the background for previous studies on the topic and looks up those people WCSJ,LRTWe get excited about positive results but every drug has side effects WCSJ,LRTWhen it comes to numbers show don tell says van Maaren Most ppl don know percentages WCSJ,LRTYour editor may say hey want this story It ok to look for other alternative angles Like teen author WCSJ,LRTWho will benefit from these findings Do lot of people have this disease Keep disease mongering in mind WCSJ,LRTAsk were you going on fishing expedition Hunting around to find significant things WCSJ,LRTWhat kind of study was it Observational Controlled trial WCSJ,LRTVan Maanen recommends getting into uni library for paper access But know this can be tough call for many WCSJ,LRTWe ve all gotten used to not trusting corp press releases academic ones have issues too WCSJ,LRTof the time you can find the limitations listed in the paper Some journals put it right in the abstract WCSJ,LRTBut in terms of timing and focus for ebola coverage Not so great Alarm didn grow Til late WCSJ,LRTDid you all do good job covering ebola on balance yes leveraged fear in responsible way WCSJ,LRTNow Oliver Yun from MSF to talk about ebola WCSJ,LRTwas very worried about infection had no insurance WCSJ,LRTIn June there wasn really western interest in ebola WCSJ,LRThas video of an ebola burial There was no dignity WCSJ,LRTUmaru says on the way home to Sierra Leone he going to be quarantined for two weeks for MERS think hes joking hope WCSJ,LRTDidn anticipate how difficult coming home would be Friends and coworkers don want to see you Ouch WCSJ,LRTsays life did continue normally People weren running around screaming WCSJ,LRTthings swung the pendulum the outbreak got worse and public health in Canada sent scientists Local bit helped WCSJ,LRTWorried about being strain on the resources about being the group to bring ebola back to Canada WCSJ,LRTsays tough to get to Africa for ebola trying to get the budget was tough and fear was factor WCSJ,LRTsniff no tea or coffee before session still none Didn get breakfast and now paying the price WCSJ,LRTNeed to be extremely rigorous with everything it not always going to be wrong but you ll know if problematic WCSJ,LRTWants to bring back muckrakers place for sci journos to deliver stories about what really going on WCSJ,LRTThat explosion of science pages was wonder of science moment but because easily expendable WCSJ,LRTsays yes at the end of the day you do need to eat and that ok need to be very transparent WCSJ,LRTQuestion as newspaper sections close people move to being PIOs what do you think of this WCSJ,LRTagrees it rough they have an investigative bureau in their uni By raising they fund journalists WCSJ,LRTNow questions Sci journos are being let go how do we fund the journalism you want to see WCSJ,LRTnow asking how much money we are following There may not be anything wrong but we should be able to see WCSJ,LRTThen there the watchdog role who is scrutinizing the way the govt spends money WCSJ,LRTnow covering fraud and misconduct and statistics says we don know how deep the iceberg is WCSJ,LRTSo peer review can be problematic when pressed for time and not able to do it properly WCSJ,LRTWho giving me the quality control had to had to work it out WCSJ on learning how to peer review,LRTwas torn wanted to do it properly and that takes time WCSJ,LRTsays where the accountability There no transparency WCSJ,LRTNow talking about the stem cell debacle asked for the peer review of the paper WCSJ couldn get it,LRTWe know these problem with replication if the foundations are shaky the results aren solid WCSJ,LRTAs result of the pressure science is under its trying to increase boundaries communicate more WCSJ,LRTnow talking about boundary theory When there are pressures sci needs to hold boundaries by communicating WCSJ,LRTnow taking about science media center in the uk which controls access to science info WCSJ,LRTIt about the ideology of being journalists and the tensions we feel in trying to be everything WCSJ,LRTSo say science journalists are acting as modest witnesses as well but Donna Harraway says we have no right WCSJ,LRTquotes about approaching things from many angles WCSJ,LRTis comparing science journalism to hamlet specifically hamlets ghost WCSJ,LRTAudience members says most journos are freelancers not enough scandals to make living WCSJ,LRTAudience members says focusing too much on scandals will lead to that being only thing covered More interesting things happen WCSJ,LRTFinal question should sci journalists work harder to expose frauds and scandals WCSJ,LRTAudience says it should be more society Science is important to society So we need that WCSJ,LRTMartin says we aren just about fraud and scandals we need to educate and communicate as well WCSJ,LRTAudience member says lead with the facts He doesn need human angle other people have that WCSJ,LRTThe right story is one that does both inform and talk about responding so this is about angles WCSJ,LRTviruses biology isn news How korea responds is news WCSJ,LRTSays if you are telling people whether or not to be scared you may feed into hype WCSJ,LRTMark says he write about biology when he in NYC but here he on the ground He can interview people MERS WCSJ,LRTOthers says they want to know about the virus first and should they be scared WCSJ,LRTAnother says it the way you present the story You use people reaction to go into what the virus is WCSJ,LRTMartin says she wants to know the basics before she wants to know the social implications WCSJ,LRTThe next question is my MERS story tomorrow would be mostly on WCSJ,LRTNow with the Internet things have changed Our stories are interesting and we can count how many people care WCSJ,LRTOn to the next question do science journalists feel disrespected by other journalists WCSJ,LRTWhere is the critical deficit Resources to practice journalism WCSJ,LRTFagin says what we need to reinforce is the journalism Says unis etc have their own ways to disseminate info WCSJ,LRTSays with limited amount of resources they need the facts not an angle that make scientists look like bad guys WCSJ,LRTSays we need more journalism to keep our hamburgers alive WCSJ,LRTAudience member says young science journalists lack ability to pitch with structure Need more journalism WCSJ,LRTSays he dislikes the use of lay people and says it condescending WCSJ,LRTWhen there new planet do we need to spend lots of time talking about where the money comes from WCSJ,LRTJack is calling for balance Martin agrees When there is something to dig up dig it up WCSJ,LRTJacks rebuttal we need education but we also need to be watchdogs Says we need to investigate agendas WCSJ,LRTOooh now we are going to debate this like the House of Commons No applause but hear hear and boo allowed WCSJ,LRTMartin says if you focus too much on fraud you may diminish interest in science Nothing but fraud lame sci section WCSJ,LRTMartin says in the current crisis is it feasible for many writers to go deep into every story WCSJ,LRTIf want to focus on policy makers we may focus more on money and fraud but when we write for general public it may be different WCSJ,LRTIn the changing journalism landscape do we need to get away from straight and more into journalism Andrew Jack explains more WCSJ,LRTStill feeling aftershocks He emphasized the role of media in reconstruction WCSJ he says we rise again,LRTHis group set up their newsroom under tent because they
