The news report in Hindu dated 11th Aug quoting me as saying 'We will decide on functioning of Parliament' is a distorted report.,LER,has_no_media
Let me explain the background. We demanded the resignation of Home Minister on account of repeated police atrocities on citizens in Delhi.,LER,has_no_media
We cited three recent examples of Police atrocities like the brutal lathi charge on Delhi BJP workers in which a BJP worker lost his eye.,LER,has_no_media
The second was midnight crackdown on Baba Ramdev supporters in which Rajbala is permanently disabled.,LER,has_no_media
The 3rd was brutal lathicharge on Yuva Morcha workers in which more than 40 workers incl one who is physically challenged suffered fractures,LER,has_no_media
A question was asked 'Shall BJP stall the Parliament till the Home Minister resigned ?',LER,has_no_media
My answer was "this is for today. We meet every morning to decide on the strategy for the day.",LER,has_no_media
This was distorted and reported as "We will decide on the functioning of the Parliament",LER,has_no_media

There are some Questions as to why we are pressing for a discussion under R 184. I will explain.,LER,has_no_media
The discussion under Rule 184 is followed by a vote whereas discussion under Rule 193 does not express the opinion of the House.,LER,has_no_media
On 7th December 2011  the then Finance Minister categorically assured the House that the decision to implement the FDI in multi brand Retail,LER,has_no_media

The Government violated this assurance and has unilaterally announced the decision to implement FDI in multi brand retail.,LER,has_no_media
Now we are left with no choice other than expressing our opinion in the House.,LER,has_no_media
