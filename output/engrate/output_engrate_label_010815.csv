It may be Friday evening but my sims engineers are still hard at work,LRT
You can find nice picture took of Mars on the DLR website please note the image is CIVA Philae ESA,LRT
One of those reasons is that my cameras don point in the same direction So if OSIRIS can see something can,LRT
don take as many pictures as OSIRIS does aboard my mothership Rosetta There are several reasons for this,LRT
would like to clarify am not carrying nuclear or other weapons or Bruce Willis do have drill though,LRT
am now just million km from the comet going to land on in and getting closer all the time now,LRT
ll do it first though Harpooning comet NASA planning to do just that,LRT

Humans should continue to explore while minimising their impact on new places and that includes going to Mars WSW,LRT
Do you think mankind should go to Mars WSW TTE,LRT
Fear is of the unknown My training had been good so there was no fear and claustrophobia was not an issue WSW TTE,LRT
Did you ever feel scared or claustrophobic when you were on the Mir space station If so what did you do to cope,LRT
Apart from the beauty of the Earth the lack of life minutiae and not seeing clear borders between countries is refreshing,ART
How did you feel the first time you looked back to Earth from space WSW TTE,LRT
carried out wide range of experiments from growing potato roots and protein crystals to testing new materials for spacecraft,LRT
What activities were you involved with while you were in space WSW TTE,LRT
Learning Russian was definitely the hardest part but as all the training was in Russian there was strong motivation WSW TTE,LRT
What did you find was the most challenging part of your training WSW TTE,LRT

NASA has minimised space work with Russia but ESA and NASA both need Russia for transport to ISS China will be important in the future,ART
How do you see the future of the ESA NASA co operation with the Russian space agency given recent setbacks from WSW,ART
Using technical equipment and applying science in factory is similar to what astronauts do in space though the views are better,LRT
How did you make the transition from those industries to the space program from WSW,LRT
What astronauts like to eat varies Often we like stronger tasting food in space because the sense of taste diminishes,ART
know sense of taste can change in space so which candy tastes better which worse from,LRT

It physics An all ice world larger than km will have gravity enough to overcome ice strength become round,HRT
Yeah but the more they re paid the more they seem to think they have all the answers and they re wrong,LRT
Something something Nice model don remember help,LRT
Huh So they are Not actually on the books to head to Phobos just proposal for now,LRT
can make the Kessel run in less than that,ART

There isn much yet but there will be soon from New Horizons For topo need overlapping photos or limb views,LRT
Temperature Too hot in early inner solar system for volatiles to condense terrestrial planets are volatile poor,ART
Depends on density which is widely variable among KBOs All are thought to be mix of mostly ice and rock,ART
The New Horizons team solicited name suggestions from the public and is working with the IAU,ART
Probably Pluto is probably mostly made of water ice Water ice is stiff enough at Pluto temp to support mountains,HRT

means as you go deeper in Pluto temp gets warmer pressure gets higher they offset almost exactly no likelier to melt at depth,HRT
Woohoo cold space ice rheology thanks,ART
McKinnon lower density of Pluto increases thickness of icy mantle increases geophysical likelihood there is still an internal ocean,HRT

Stern Particularly for children Pluto is dimunutive and they re diminutive there an association there,ART
Stern There no single reason people love Pluto There lot of different reasons,HRT
Grunsfeld Pluto is capstone of our solar system exploration and also it opening up new realm,HRT
Stern explains color data is much more expensive in terms of bits to get it to the ground which is why more LORRI pics have come down,HRT
Cathy Olkin promises new color images tomorrow,HRT
Blerg Yes,LRT
Stern People on the team talk lot about how surreal it is that we re actually finally here But the energy level is electric,ART
Stern New Horizons cruise is not record Rosetta set record But Rosetta had many flybys so didn seem like interminable road trip,HRT
Stern SDC hears all the thruster findings so we have to change the squelch level so we quiet down the racket from the thrusters,HRT
Eris is bright and super far away hence cold When it is much closer to the Sun it prob has Pluto like atmosphere,HRT

Yes let,HRT
Stern was interrupted by Siri on somebody phone just now,LRT
note has just been passed to Grunsfeld who passed it to Stern who nodded and passed it to Fountain whatcoulditbe,ART
understand you have to put miles on graphics for Americans but for love of Pete why can you also put metric measurements,HRT
Stern We detected escaping nitrogen before expected Either escaping faster than we thought or mechanism is different than thought,HRT
Stern Pluto radius is km It settles the debate about the largest object in the Kuiper belt,HRT
Stern It sounds like science fiction but it not fills out one of my NewHorizonsBingo squares,ART

OGLE TR is an even bigger closer roaster Jup size with an even tighter day orbit it no place to spend the holidays,LRT
New planets HAT is hot Jupiter type planet that about Jup size and has quick day orbit time another roaster,LRT
Planet portraits keep rolling in French astronomers managed to snap pic of planet orbiting the bright star beta Pic,LRT
Its sister planet HD is bit bigger Jup size and orbits farther away AU albeit with pretty eccentric orbit,LRT
And the planet train doesn stop HD is about the size of Jup and snuggles right up to its host star with an day orbit,LRT
So we re up to planets discovered but more importantly we finally have visible light images of exoplanets Christmas comes early,LRT
And finally HR orbits at AU and sits about AU from its star Both HD and Fomalhaut are visible from Earth stars only,LRT
HR is another big ol gas giant Jup size orbiting its star at distance of AU That makes for day long year,LRT
One of the trio of planets that was imaged HR is about Jupiter size and orbits hefty AU from its host also blue star,LRT
One of the imaged planets Fomalhaut is no bigger than Jupiter size It orbits about AU from its host young blue star,LRT
Here another link with better picture of the three planets discovered from the ground,LRT
And it doesn stop there Scientists also managed to snap pics of more from the GROUND wow Check it out,LRT
Hubble has snapped one of the first pictures of an exoplanet Take look here,LRT
BIG exoplanet news coming up later today Stay tuned,LRT
So now we re up to planets These latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky using the radial velocity method,LRT
Now this is big one HD is Jupiter size and has really odd eccentric orbit Planet or brown dwarf It not clear yet,LRT
HD is Jupiter mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was Earth orbits from our Sun,LRT
Correction to the last post planet name is HD Yet another poetic exoplanet moniker,LRT
Halloween planets HD is gas giant about the size of Jupiter with an orbit about as far out from its star as Mars is,LRT
That makes new planets discovered and brings our planet count to Get the fine details on these cool new worlds at,LRT
HD is gas giant with super eccentric orbit if it orbited our sun it would swing from closer than Mercury to farther than Mars,LRT
HD is massive planet the size of Jupiter It has very eccentric orbit that takes it days to complete,LRT
HD is the size of Jupiter with an orbit of days around star just hotter than our sun about as long as Mars year,LRT
BD is big ol Jupiter size planet with pretty eccentric day orbit around its small star,LRT
HD is also in the constellation Scorpio is the size of Jupiter and is bit further from its star than Earth is at AU,LRT
Lots of new planets to announce HD is almost the size of Jupiter and orbits about half an AU from sunlike star,LRT
Lupus TR is back on the list new evidence shows it planet This is Jupiter size world that only AU from its star Hot,LRT
Looks like Lupus TR might actually be part of multiple star and not actually planet so we re dropping it from the count for now,LRT
Weird COROT exo is the size of Jupiter but its mass Scientists aren yet sure just what it actually is Link,LRT
Looks like the HAT and WASP teams found the same planet at the same time So now it called HAT WASP and the count is back to,LRT
This actually just refers to extrasolar planets not in our own solar system good question,LRT
For those keeping score this brings us up to planets discovered and multi planet solar systems so far it busy neighborhood,LRT
And HD is more than the size of Jupiter and orbits its star about as far away as Mars is from our sun,LRT
Looks like today triple play for new planets HD is just about the size of Jupiter and orbits at abou AU from its star,LRT
New planet added today CT Cha crams Jup masses into planet just times as big and orbiting AU possibly brown dwarf,LRT
MOA BLG was discovered using gravitational lensing an exotic way to hunt for planets using light bent by the gravity from stars,LRT
New planet for Talk Like Pirate Day Not much info yet about MOA BLG it about the size of Jupiter and AU from its star,LRT
It been busy week for planet hunters new gas giants announced and one retracted for total count of exoplanets discovered,LRT
NASA has announced the Carl Sagan Fellowships in Exoplanet Exploration The stipend will be year to selected postdocs,LRT
Remember to see the stats for any of these planets just visit and type in the name of the planet,LRT
TW Hydrae has been dropped from the atlas due to findings that it might have been detection of stellar spots instead,LRT
And one more HD which is about the size of Jupiter AU from its star which is just about Sun size Big planet,LRT
HD was also announced it times the size of Jupiter and orbits about AU from its star which is the size of the sun,LRT
At long last we have some new planet updates GJ is about half the size of Jupiter and orbits AU from its tiny host star,LRT
New story on planetquest jpl nasa gov Backyard planet hunting Amateur astronomers join the exoplanet race,LRT
New BIG planet And is light years away times the mass of Jupiter and has day orbit See planetquest jpl nasa gov,LRT
New planet Cet is light years away times the mass of Jupiter and has day orbital period See planetquest jpl nasa gov,LRT

New exoplanet info released today HAT It hot Jupiter type planet with day orbit Info at planetquest jpl nasa gov atlas,LRT
The number of exoplanets discovered has passed the mark with the latest announcements currently it at,LRT
Just an FYI the PlanetQuest site is planetquest jpl nasa gov,LRT
New Super Earths discovered plus evidence that there are many more Details on PlanetQuest,LRT
Another new exoplanet around HD posted times Jupiter mass AU from the star day period,LRT
New exoplanet posted today times the mass of Jupiter with day orbital period orbiting AU from the star HD,LRT
New exoplanet posted today times the mass of Jupiter with day orbital period orbiting AU from the star HD,LRT

And of course years ago Eris was Xena Makemake was Easterbunny Haumea was Santa It took me long time to start using the real names,HRT
So yrs ago today was pretty exciting day was on the Today show With Lilah Which was nice so my mom could see her for st time,ART
Haumea was announced yrs ago yesterday fastest spinning large body in solar system Multiple moons Family of collisional fragments Wow,HRT
Makemake was announced on the same day as Eris years ago Surface is covered in slabs of methane Awesome place Let go,HRT
Things we ve learned If Eris had been at its closest point to the sun Clyde Tombaugh would likely have discovered it yrs ago,HRT
Things we ve learned about Eris in yrs its surface reflects almost of the sunlight that hits it because of that frozen atmosphere,HRT
Things we ve learned about Eris in yrs its orbit is inclined by degrees to the plane of the planets Which still doesn make sense,HRT
Things we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has satellite Dysnomia that we think was formed in giant impact Maybe,HRT
Things we ve learned about Eris in yrs it is much more massive than Pluto yet tiny bit smaller thus much rockier on the inside,HRT
Things we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has very Pluto like surface composition though at the distance the atmosphere is frozen,HRT
yrs ago today Lilah was days old And we announced the discovery of Eris Lilah was not pleased that was gone all day Sorry Lilah,HRT
People will continue ground based observations of the atmosphere over the next years and would bet it is still there mostly the same,HRT
hate to be the voice of Pluto sobriety or any sobriety but that whole Pluto atmosphere has collapsed in year thing smells fishy,HRT
Yay More Charon My current explanation huh,HRT
So are the mountains and the big ice mound somehow related Not obvious how But Hmmmm Or perhaps just seeing things Again,HRT
Also interesting to me in the full Pluto image don think see anymore spiky mountains like the ones in the SW of Tombaugh,HRT
Anybody else think the two big craters on the left are from the impact of near contact binary KBO,HRT
Other places likely to have cool CH flows Makemake Eris Quaoar OR Fun to see Pluto to better understand these too,HRT
In my view the ice flows are the coolest things found on Pluto so far Still want more Charon though,HRT
Sounds like people have water on Mars style press release fatigue Hard to blame them really,HRT
Just interview by BBC presenter about Kepler who said look haven we more or less heard all of this before And um yeah kinda,HRT
As mentioned earlier today this is thoroughly awesome On reflection it remains awesome,HRT
love to see more of that dark terrain on Pluto THAT where we ll learn whether or not there is internal activity think Soon Ish,HRT
Ah Plenty of craters on Pluto where they re not covered by ices Which is of course what was expected all along,HRT
Also if understand IAU rules correctly but does anyone if we still don get around to naming OR by its up for grabs,ART
Haze in the craters of Ceres OK That counts as awesome,HRT
Happy to see my favorite wikipedia dwarf planet image updated so quickly,HRT
OK Pluto That was fun Now back to work Today Europa Trojan asteroids And super secret project with the code name Phattie,HRT
Awesomeness,HRT
It ice volcanoes all the way down,HRT
think we have winner,HRT
So what good word for frost moving around on surface to distinguish from geological activity My brain is failing to get one,HRT
Also worth noting that geologically active generally means interior rumblings Clearly frosts move around on Pluto surface,HRT
Most are also hoping that Pluto is active just want better evidence If it true we ll know soon Also if not,HRT
In current hallway conversations with planetary scientists most are unconvinced by the evidence that Pluto is geologically active,HRT
BBC Newsday Right Now,HRT
wife opens wines pours me glass thanks honey,HRT
Going to be live on the BBC in hours Which is morning there But is making me pondering whether or not to open this bottle of wine,ART

Sure it OK to grandfather Pluto in as planet Also you can grandfather the Earth as flat too if that makes you feel better,HRT
ll be there at the Planetary Society thing tonight listening for the NH signal Come say hi Throw ice or something,HRT
If you re local amp looking for place to geek out on Pluto tonight come to the Planetary Society event in Pasadena,HRT
Every time someone says Pluto looks really interesting thus should be planet Titan sheds an alkane tear,HRT
Or maybe not Figuring out if that is plausible requires getting out the pencil and doing calculations Which too sleepy to do now,HRT
equatorial ice melting decades earlier Once it starts it spreads around the equator Leaving the heart for last,HRT
Is it coincidence that the heart is on the anti Charon side Maybe light from Charon provided just enough extra heat to start the,HRT
My best is that if you came back in years the heart would be gone which sounds kind of sad and dark regions would extend further,HRT
BUT the bright patch really shouldnt be at the equator That one of the warmest spots The rest of the equator is ice free as expected,HRT
Not surprising to have ice patches coming and going Pluto goes through seasonal temperature extremes so that is expected,HRT
That heart on Pluto sure is odd It appears to be thick ice patch that is being slowing eaten away at the edges,HRT
So apparently my autocorrexts changes autocorrexts to autocorrexts Automatically,HRT
Also the dark patch at Charon north pole definitely looks more interesting than initially gave it credit for,HRT
Watch Charon probably the most similar thing in the solar system to Orcus at least on the surface,HRT
Ohhh crater rays on Charon Awesome And might the tiny white splotches be my ice volcanoes want ice volcanoes,HRT
Useful to keep in mind Pluto size and density in the context of other objects from the Kuiper belt,HRT
Hey so is it too early to suggest that the big heart on Pluto whatever it turns out to be be named Tombaugh,HRT
Back in offered these thoughts on the critical question of whether Eris or Pluto is bigger on,HRT
Odd that Eris is tiny bit smaller than Pluto but so much more massive They are quite different bodies in many ways Maybe we should go,HRT
good sign would be that Charon pole is not just darker but also red think we ll get color info soon,HRT
Lilah thinks the bright craters on Charon might be ice volcanoes She listened to too many of my phone interviews,ART
Pluto still pretty inscrutable at this distance More resolution please oh you will thanks,HRT
endorse,HRT
month ago suggested Charon would look like Uranus moon Ariel Similarities pretty good so far,HRT
Yay got my Charon craters Now where are my ice flow plains,HRT
We re approaching the summer solstice after which most of the northern ices might have headed south Process already starting now,HRT
In the fig the solid line shows the latitude of the sun time the dark regions show where the ice has evaporated white is ice,HRT
Here figure from that Hansen amp Paige paper showing how Pluto surface ices move around with time,HRT
Even now that about all can say Amazing how fast this is all going to come and go and how much we will wish we saw but didn,HRT
On Charon the brightest spots are likely to be ammonia rich water ice flows Dark spots not dark just lack of water flows,HRT
OK what about Charon Still too low detail want craters damnit And want them now But will have to wait,HRT
Conclusions even at this range it is really really hard to learn details of what is going on here Recommendation Go closer,HRT
of that sort Your eye is good at playing tricks on you suspect that on the nicely imaged side you ll see no giant polygons,HRT
What are the polygonal features Not polygons Seems unlikely any physical process could form large scale linear features cont,HRT
evaporating and going poleward Come back in years and it might look just like the equator Again nicely modeled in Hansen amp Paige,HRT
North of the dark equator are the patchy tropics Summer has started here recently so suspect this is where ice is currently cont,HRT
Still weird that it is at equator Maybe something interesting going on there Keep your eye out,HRT
The heart could just be random feedback It bright so reflects sunlight so cold so gets icy gets brighter gets colder etc,HRT
Why is the dark equatorial band not continuous No clue The heart looks like the brightest spot on the surface and its equatorial,HRT
dark substrate behind Dark substrate is probably tholins Tholins organic muck sorry,HRT
by Hansen and Paige who showed how nitrogen evaporates from the warm equatorial regions and reaccumulates at the poles leaving cont,HRT
The dominant feature on Pluto is the dark but not quite continuous equatorial band This was nicely explained in in paper cont,HRT
OK friends the Pluto and Charon images are good enough for new round of speculation Let start here,HRT
do another round of Pluto image speculation but soon we reach the intersection of speculation and information ll wait Just little,HRT
The latest Pluto images remind me of early adaptive optics images of Titan totally cool and thoroughly uninterpretable Soon though Soon,HRT
Just back from vacation What all of this Pluto stuff everyone is talking about,HRT

Lilah being California girl was freaked out by the lightning Me being an Alabama boy found it awesome Diane Neutral,LRT
That your pluto update for today coming from our bost mooring in Montfoort Netherlands Recent site of an epic lightning storm,LRT
so far nothing on pluto Charon to be surprised about But images are quickly getting better Stay tuned,HRT
Charon looks grayer because it too small to keep nitrogen or methane from escaping so only has old water ice on its surface,HRT
peach relatively fresh methane starting to degrade Dark old warm ice free degraded methane,HRT
on Pluto darker spots get warmer drove off ices get warmer still drive off more ices etc etc So white cold nitrogen ice,HRT
methane breaks apart and turns reddish when exposed to sunlight and space Pluto is patchy probably because of feedback,HRT
Time for your periodic Pluto speculations So far all is as expected Pluto is peach colored because of methane,HRT
couldn capture good pic of Jupiter Venus so present to you Diane boat deck full moon beer Gouda,HRT

In Amsterdam this weekend wife yr old daughter Tips Advice Suggestions Best bets For gods sake dont go theres,LRT
That all see to speculate on right now But it only gets better,LRT
Pluto likely mottled because of surface feedback slightly darker areas get warmer drive off ices get darker get warmer get darker,HRT
Why is Pluto so mottled looking Deconvolution will make it appear more so than it really is but we know that it really IS,HRT
Why don we see such ice on Pluto Likely there just covered in CH CO frosts amp might be morphologically similar under the frost,HRT
Where do ice flows on Charon come from The ancient interior ocean now frozen out but once erupting onto the surface,HRT
Dark polar cap on Charon Unlikely to be dark ice frost cap but rather lack of bright stuff What is bright stuff Ice flows,HRT
Now with that first go read this and then let do some idle speculation,HRT
