The comet is also so dark you can't see it #tricky #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaBut that risk comes not from the drinking per se  but doing stupid things  #sydsciencefest #kindathinky,LER,has_no_mediaAW: Kids become desensitised. So you have the option to get more angry  which is irrational #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaDK: Have you ever tried to guess an absolute weight?  You just can't really.  We are better at relative guesses #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaThis weekend we have heaps of events including a science debate  some universe chat and blowing things up! #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaSW: You know how you go through your phone photos and there are heaps of your face by accident?

Myth 1 is that punishment changes bad behaviour #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaDK: Can we predict when you are going to make a decision? #ssf15 #askdrkarl,LER,has_no_mediaSW: My first photo was of a half a field mice. But a year later  we got some of cougars #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaSW: Back then it was almost impossible to see a snow leopard. We saw one on the first day. Then the second.   Then never again for 6 months,LER,has_no_mediaAW: Best option is adding in +ve reinforcement  or else kids just won't know what you want when you yell at them #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaSB up first chatting about how she can make us live forever  more or less. #sydsciencefest #kindathinky,LER,has_no_mediaPermissive: uncomfortable with rules and being an authority figure  Disciplinary: Rules all the way Authoritative: Rules but understanding,LER,has_no_mediaDK: It rests with the teachers.  To get into science  you do need to get through the difficult stuff  but it doesn't have to be boring,LER,has_no_media"One of his mates told him the next day ""oh don't worry  that was just a black jaguar"".   ""And that's how Big Cats chose me..."" #ssf15",LER,has_no_mediaPart 3: Colour constancy.

They really are just quite big. #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaSW: After 15 months  I finally got a shot of one in front of the Hollywood sign #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaKS: I try to teach students not to argue with someone who is so obviously science illiterate  because they bring the argument down #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaHumans just tense the whole time (self awareness  fear  etc). So don't try this at home plz #ssf15,LER,has_no_media"Myth 3: ""Lots of praise spoils your kids"". Research has shown that praise can be the most effective form of reinforcement #sydsciencefest",LER,has_no_mediaOne exception  DK says  is that sometimes it is possible to bring forth abilities we didn't know we had access to. #ssf15 #askdrkarl,LER,has_no_mediaIt's interesting how much clients can not actually conceptualize space #sydsciencefest #kindathinky,LER,has_no_mediaDK: Time is real  and it exists by itself.  Our version of time is a construct #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaHe used a 'Camera Trap'. Then only used by scientists  it is a way to use laser trip beams to take photos of difficult to catch animals,LER,has_no_mediaNext Q  the arrow of time!  What's up with that? #askdrkarl #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaThere was a house in the news the other day that had a SIXTEEN CAR GARAGE #sydsciencefest #kindathinky,LER,has_no_mediaSW: I really wanted to get a photo of a mountain lion on front of the Hollywood sign.

This plan is basically...  Big Brother meets interplanetary travel! #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaMP: One of the best things about space travel (now) is that you are all from Earth. You just have to work together. Eg. @ISS_Research #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaSW: People use rhino horn for supposed medicinal value. It's made of keratin. You're better off chewing your nails #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaDC: We have thrown evolution on its head  by living longer  having babies later #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaSW: The protection of rhinos is the only one in India that has a shoot to kill policy #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaBiggest problem for space travel is cost. So  the Big Brother Space Travel idea solves that with reality TV funding.  Seriously.  #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaI believe this is the first image  in that crevice  looking into deep space @esa @Philae2014 #sydsciencefest http://t.co/BVWEzjhTfL,LER,has_photoSW: The alarm call for a tiger is a spotted deer squeak. You hear that  there's a tiger nearby. #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaDK: The easiest way out is  you should consider getting into politics.  The only way you can have power in this  is to become a politician,LER,has_no_mediaSW: ecotourism  next gen education  working with local communities - all things that help stop this hunting #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaAW: We haven't managed to evolve to fight off parasites. And you know who we need to help us? Chemists.  #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaSW: I got a picture of a cougar. A bobcat. A deer. A raccoon. A guy walking his dog. Some hikers. But no mountain lion. #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaDK: Some people in Med got jealous  some people didn't care  but basically it's just a different field #askdrkarl #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaThe end of an amazing talk by @swfoto tonight. Wrapping up with some questions... #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaDC: But dont try walking around naked saying that a scientist said the Naked Ape idea is a myth #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaDC: humans are not as naked as we think we are. Our bodies have the same coverage as apes  its just fair and thin #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaAW: Chemistry has also given us the best TV show ever made; Breaking Bad.  #faircall #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaDK?
