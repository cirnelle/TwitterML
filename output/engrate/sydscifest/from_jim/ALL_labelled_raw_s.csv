They are very endangered  hard to find and highly revered  #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaSW: Even though these cats were tagged to study them in relation to wolf packs  I still had a lot of trouble photographing them #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaAND Manly Library is hosting a talk about the big bang  the internet and then everything that happened in between http://t.co/cLXpFlrS2C,LER,has_no_mediaMP has a plan to get herself into space. This plan is basically...  Big Brother meets interplanetary travel! #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaMP: One of the best things about space travel (now) is that you are all from Earth. You just have to work together. Eg. @ISS_Research #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaSW: People use rhino horn for supposed medicinal value. It's made of keratin. You're better off chewing your nails #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaDC: We have thrown evolution on its head  by living longer  having babies later #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaSW: The protection of rhinos is the only one in India that has a shoot to kill policy #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaBiggest problem for space travel is cost. So  the Big Brother Space Travel idea solves that with reality TV funding.  Seriously.  #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaI believe this is the first image  in that crevice  looking into deep space @esa @Philae2014 #sydsciencefest http://t.co/BVWEzjhTfL,LER,has_photoSW: The alarm call for a tiger is a spotted deer squeak.

And you know who we need to help us? Chemists.  #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaSW: I got a picture of a cougar. A bobcat. A deer. A raccoon. A guy walking his dog. Some hikers. But no mountain lion. #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaDK: Some people in Med got jealous  some people didn't care  but basically it's just a different field #askdrkarl #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaThe end of an amazing talk by @swfoto tonight. Wrapping up with some questions... #ssf15,LER,has_no_mediaDC: But dont try walking around naked saying that a scientist said the Naked Ape idea is a myth #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaDC: humans are not as naked as we think we are. Our bodies have the same coverage as apes  its just fair and thin #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaAW: Chemistry has also given us the best TV show ever made; Breaking Bad.  #faircall #sydsciencefest,LER,has_no_mediaDK?
