end,LRTMaybe because they are so much less work than my other videos The result appears quickly and magically with unplanned snail choreography,LRTbalance between recording years old stuff before it forgotten reposting inaccessible content from previous website and new stuff,LRTYou have another track from me tonight if other humans didn so selfishly want to live near the same places do and also make loud noise,LRTdon know how the details of reddit work or why there two threads and the older bigger one doesn show up those are just the links,LRTThere is zero way to tell whether the video will ever actually begin processing or if it needs to be deleted and re uploaded this happens,LRTSince my experiments with held for review comments taught me that youtube spam filters are over fail yeah approve all,LRTack held for review on my main channel APPROVE ALL,LRTTurns out there another non way to get to the held comments Just approved of held comments on my second channel,LRTfeel little better now about the whole moving buttons thing,LRTam so burnt out from the past few weeks the only thing can feel emotions for is anger at purposefully misleading web design,LRTLuckily ve got different versions of PP and different versions of the gif and found combo that works,LRTPremiere Pro gif summary doesn work in CS for mac and some gifs that open in other programs don seem to work for windows Others do,LRTSomeone please tell me that Abobe Premiere Pro does in fact support gifs and just not importing them correctly,LRTIt feels lot like when finally record and listen to self composed ear worm that been in my head for months,LRTthese are the kind of things that keep me up at night,LRTIt like they know that rather fork over than do more paperwork and phone calls,LRTpurpose We are,LRTOn,LRTIt what we do on,LRTsuppose that link isn as easy to memorize for those unfamiliar with dftba Point still stands though,LRTThe breathing sound effect with echo on one ear so you get what was talking about,LRTMost YT comment sections are predictable This one has surprises for me Love that people are analyzing and picking favourite times,LRTdon think ve recorded something with strings since What is up with Noises should do this more often,LRThalfway through making the certificates of authenticity and they are getting weird,LRTHotSriscotcholateTips add to taste,LRTHotSriscotcholateTips use small fork not spoon Tines close enough to heap mix onto but mixes better,LRTNeither do think Google YouTube problem is that their comments are bad though do find it funny So all can stop worrying,LRTwhich is not surprising given that spent good amount of time on it and it not about math,LRTwanted to finish video this week and instead finished piano piece ve been working on for months ll take it,LRTor else they be tired of it as am and pick books like Pale Fire and Invisible Cities over books like Lolita and If on Winter etc,LRTYes like all of those books,LRTadmit read it ten years ago but was very much not fan,LRTAs you maybe guessed at this point going through lists of great literature and commenting on things ve read,LRTplus the form of it so much fun so different,LRTRe Lolita Yes it is beautiful and extremely disturbing and excellent Pale Fire is also very creepy but more subtly and about man,LRTBut still hopefully will finish tonight Back to filming,LRTgetting bug where when click on channel it keeps the branding banner it displayed on the last channel unless refresh,LRTCan YT subscribers report back on where or whether my most recent video appeared on your YouTube home page or subscription list and such,LRTalso let me know if everything works because sometimes am bad at things,LRTnote that the talk contains references to things that had happened the previous day of the conference like agriculture and the gif booths,LRTAnd that not considering that this is already part two had to slice off because script got too long,LRTOh noooooo have nine new books on my kindle and three in the mail You folks don actually want more videos or an updated website right,LRTSo if anyone has recommendations along those lines do tell,LRTAnyone have any books they are super excited about at the moment,LRTwait that used broken twice in row Uhhh uncharged phones dead cell phones,LRTif the buzzing would just stay the

chosen for further tech dev We don know what that means,LRTWhile they get started and now that it is post PM will tell you my news NASAEuropa,LRTnotaliens,LRTtheoretically everyone now knows the outcome for their own instrument and is just awaiting the presser to know the other outcomes,LRTHey so is there hashtag other than askNASA for this Europa presser cc or can someone pick one,LRTscientists are ppl and ppl need support from their friends Europa news is starting to propagate through the community,LRTPSBTW forgot to mention none of us know if they are announcing final instrument selections today or if it is just down select Wheeeee,LRTll probably live tweet the presser Until then going to try to work and not think about Europa Happy Europa Day,LRTBtw is calling the PIs this morning So they will already know before the presser,LRTon mass spec proposal out of NASA Goddard know of at least other mass spec proposals Presumably the payload will include mass spec,LRTAka Saturday,LRTBecause this was an exoplanets proposal gasp why is Titan so small,LRTNow can do my grading yay sigh,LRTThis is one of my all time favorite pictures Happy th anniversary,LRTlt the ppl who at PM before proposal deadline respond to help please turn this into science words with SCIENCE WORDS,LRTPeanut also thinks the direct costs are not justified because there are not enough funds requested for dog treats,LRTPeanut is not convinced that the proposal sufficiently justifies the level of effort requested for the proposed investigations VG,LRTmy proposal still isn done and have proposal brain and can do it anymore and ahhhhhh,LRTOf course wouldn be conflicted for doing such study because AM NOT NASA FUNDED SCIENTIST True story,LRTOf course

piece is in for how poppies make morphine And my prev post on the topic,LRTNew Eureka Lab Science and fashion come together in dress that charges your smartphone,LRTCrime scenes often need scientists to find out whodunnit This week Scientists Say,LRTWe might all know axe and arrowhead but adze is bit much Otoh we had great time imagining what adzing was So there that,LRTMuseums please help me out and define things Went to several in the past few weeks displaying adzes What is an adze Had to look it up,LRTIn the wake of the LaCour scandal talks about the ethics of

great to see while she in town And she brought me Mars bars because she is the BEST,LRTPrev link via,LRTMongooses know how NOT to keep it in the family,LRTLady mice can block the scent of man,LRTDefinitely worth knowing about Bad bird flu still spreading,LRTjust got signed copy of boo at the SFO airport How did even get that lucky bounce,LRTBold relentless experimentation with integrity is going to have to be our lodestar WCSJ,LRTBest sites are enduring funders don influence the journalists We need those firewall policies WCSJ,LRTalso references and says older groups like becoming more sure footed WCSJ,LRTSomething similar may be happening at now building capacity to do deep work WCSJ,LRTSome formerly cut rate places are now raising their game doing good journalism says referring to WCSJ,LRTThere at least three hopeful responses underway None are ideal But they giving us good digital journalism WCSJ,LRTrd problem with audience atomization is it creates opportunities for mischief by special interest groups WCSJ,LRTCross cultural conversations are being stifled by this atomization of interest WCSJ,LRTBut even as we are converging in multimedia tools we are diverging in our content Easy to build information bubble WCSJ,LRTIt time when they can tell more transparent vivid contextual stories WCSJ,LRTIncreasingly think the same media convergence will be occurring all over the world WCSJ,LRTIt all sounds pretty grim and yet there are reasons not to lose hope WCSJ,LRTThe emergence of the Internet only made us more confident we thought we knew what tank man wanted WCSJ,LRTremembers the incident at Tiananmen Square We know about it because there were journalists there WCSJ,LRTnotes that he knows the US best and apologizes for any bias in the talk WCSJ,LRTwants to step back and look at the big picture How did we get here Where are we going WCSJ,LRTNow hearing talk at WCSJ Squee Someday ll get brave enough to introduce myself,LRTNow final statement fill voids and feed curiosity Grow your own voice WCSJ,LRTMarie Pier Elie never be satisfied Keep digging WCSJ,LRTShow people what you are doing as you do it with Instagram etc get people excited before story comes out WCSJ,LRTSometimes words aren enough comics can be powerful media says WCSJ,LRTdid piece on einsteins visit to Argentina to promote it he tweeted like he was at the visit in WCSJ,LRThas strategies using fiction to capture attention and spark imagination WCSJ,LRTsays you have to punch through the pseudoscience How do you get through the noise WCSJ have to be interesting,LRTtalks about blending science and sci fi Like this WCSJ,LRTNow on strategies for digital storytelling WCSJ,LRTMarie tells the story of one camera crew that tried to manufacture fight between scientists Yikes WCSJ,LRTHighlight the human element to help viewers feel their motivations But again it rigor Marie says WCSJ,LRTMany scientists do much better when they think the camera is off Marie says Basic questions help too WCSJ,LRTHow do you find interviewees who are both knowledgable and charismatic Marie says pretty rare Knowledgeability is mandatory WCSJ,LRTWe only have to find what is sexy in science It not about forcing sexy on top of science says Marie WCSJ,LRTMarie says what you decide not to tell if just as important as what you decide to tell Do pruning for the relevant information WCSJ,LRTBut entertainment without rigor is even worse WCSJ how do you build narrative for audience with limited attention span,LRTNOW Marie Pier Elie Notes that rigor without any entertainment is no good in TV WCSJ,LRTEmilie says she was writing about cosmic rays and an observatory Turns out observatory was too small WCSJ,LRTOh sorry Current comments are from Emilie Martin their name plaques are mixed up WCSJ,LRTScientist complained there was too much human factor and not enough science WCSJ,LRTShe ended up writing about how people lived at the research station who they were etc WCSJ the scientist hated it,LRTMarie Piere Elie says she went to see scientists finding auroras but had no luck with the science WCSJ,LRTNow in entertainment and rigor can they coexist WCSJ,LRTLunch at WCSJ Lovely presentation,LRTlooks to the background for previous studies on the topic and looks up those people WCSJ,LRTWe get excited about positive results but every drug has side effects WCSJ,LRTWhen it comes to numbers show don tell says van Maaren Most ppl don know percentages WCSJ,LRTYour editor may say hey want this story It ok to look for other alternative angles Like teen author WCSJ,LRTWho will benefit from these findings Do lot of people have this disease Keep disease mongering in mind WCSJ,LRTAsk were you going on fishing expedition Hunting around to find significant things WCSJ,LRTWhat kind of study was it Observational Controlled trial WCSJ,LRTVan Maanen recommends getting into uni library for paper access But know this can be tough call for many WCSJ,LRTWe ve all gotten used to not trusting corp press releases academic ones have issues too WCSJ,LRTof the time you can find the limitations listed in the paper Some journals put it right in the abstract WCSJ,LRTBut in terms of timing and focus for ebola coverage Not so great Alarm didn grow Til late WCSJ,LRTDid you all do good job covering ebola on balance yes leveraged fear in responsible way WCSJ,LRTNow Oliver Yun from MSF to talk about ebola WCSJ,LRTwas very worried about infection had no insurance WCSJ,LRTIn June there wasn really western interest in ebola WCSJ,LRThas video of an ebola burial There was no dignity WCSJ,LRTUmaru says on the way home to Sierra Leone he going to be quarantined for two weeks for MERS think hes joking hope WCSJ,LRTDidn anticipate how difficult coming home would be Friends and coworkers don want to see you Ouch WCSJ,LRTsays life did continue normally People weren running around screaming WCSJ,LRTthings swung the pendulum the outbreak got worse and public health in Canada sent scientists Local bit helped WCSJ,LRTWorried about being strain on the resources about being the group to bring ebola back to Canada WCSJ,LRTsays tough to get to Africa for ebola trying to get the budget was tough and fear was factor WCSJ,LRTsniff no tea or coffee before session still none Didn get breakfast and now paying the price WCSJ,LRTNeed to be extremely rigorous with everything it not always going to be wrong but you ll know if problematic WCSJ,LRTWants to bring back muckrakers place for sci journos to deliver stories about what really going on WCSJ,LRTThat explosion of science pages was wonder of science moment but because easily expendable WCSJ,LRTsays yes at the end of the day you do need to eat and that ok need to be very transparent WCSJ,LRTQuestion as newspaper sections close people move to being PIOs what do you think of this WCSJ,LRTagrees it rough they have an investigative bureau in their uni By raising they fund journalists WCSJ,LRTNow questions Sci journos are being let go how do we fund the journalism you want to see WCSJ,LRTnow asking how much money we are following There may not be anything wrong but we should be able to see WCSJ,LRTThen there the watchdog role who is scrutinizing the way the govt spends money WCSJ,LRTnow covering fraud and misconduct and statistics says we don know how deep the iceberg is WCSJ,LRTSo peer review can be problematic when pressed for time and not able to do it properly WCSJ,LRTWho giving me the quality control had to had to work it out WCSJ on learning how to peer review,LRTwas torn wanted to do it properly and that takes time WCSJ,LRTsays where the accountability There no transparency WCSJ,LRTNow talking about the stem cell debacle asked for the peer review of the paper WCSJ couldn get it,LRTWe know these problem with replication if the foundations are shaky the results aren solid WCSJ,LRTAs result of the pressure science is under its trying to increase boundaries communicate more WCSJ,LRTnow talking about boundary theory When there are pressures sci needs to hold boundaries by communicating WCSJ,LRTnow taking about science media center in the uk which controls access to science info WCSJ,LRTIt about the ideology of being journalists and the tensions we feel in trying to be everything WCSJ,LRTSo say science journalists are acting as modest witnesses as well but Donna Harraway says we have no right WCSJ,LRTquotes about approaching things from many angles WCSJ,LRTis comparing science journalism to hamlet specifically hamlets ghost WCSJ,LRTAudience members says most journos are freelancers not enough scandals to make living WCSJ,LRTAudience members says focusing too much on scandals will lead to that being only thing covered More interesting things happen WCSJ,LRTFinal question should sci journalists work harder to expose frauds and scandals WCSJ,LRTAudience says it should be more society Science is important to society So we need that WCSJ,LRTMartin says we aren just about fraud and scandals we need to educate and communicate as well WCSJ,LRTAudience member says lead with the facts He doesn need human angle other people have that WCSJ,LRTThe right story is one that does both inform and talk about responding so this is about angles WCSJ,LRTviruses biology isn news How korea responds is news WCSJ,LRTSays if you are telling people whether or not to be scared you may feed into hype WCSJ,LRTMark says he write about biology when he in NYC but here he on the ground He can interview people MERS WCSJ,LRTOthers says they want to know about the virus first and should they be scared WCSJ,LRTAnother says it the way you present the story You use people reaction to go into what the virus is WCSJ,LRTMartin says she wants to know the basics before she wants to know the social implications WCSJ,LRTThe next question is my MERS story tomorrow would be mostly on WCSJ,LRTNow with the Internet things have changed Our stories are interesting and we can count how many people care WCSJ,LRTOn to the next question do science journalists feel disrespected by other journalists WCSJ,LRTWhere is the critical deficit Resources to practice journalism WCSJ,LRTFagin says what we need to reinforce is the journalism Says unis etc have their own ways to disseminate info WCSJ,LRTSays with limited amount of resources they need the facts not an angle that make scientists look like bad guys WCSJ,LRTSays we need more journalism to keep our hamburgers alive WCSJ,LRTAudience member says young science journalists lack ability to pitch with structure Need more journalism WCSJ,LRTSays he dislikes the use of lay people and says it condescending WCSJ,LRTWhen there new planet do we need to spend lots of time talking about where the money comes from WCSJ,LRTJack is calling for balance Martin agrees When there is something to dig up dig it up WCSJ,LRTJacks rebuttal we need education but we also need to be watchdogs Says we need to investigate agendas WCSJ,LRTOooh now we are going to debate this like the House of Commons No applause but hear hear and boo allowed WCSJ,LRTMartin says if you focus too much on fraud you may diminish interest in science Nothing but fraud lame sci section WCSJ,LRTMartin says in the current crisis is it feasible for many writers to go deep into every story WCSJ,LRTIf want to focus on policy makers we may focus more on money and fraud but when we write for general public it may be different WCSJ,LRTIn the changing journalism landscape do we need to get away from straight and more into journalism Andrew Jack explains more WCSJ,LRTStill feeling aftershocks He emphasized the role of media in reconstruction WCSJ he says we rise again,LRTHis group set up their newsroom under tent because they couldn go in the building WCSJ family members also with them,LRTHe walked to the

tank,LRTOur explanatory metaphors for the mind really do follow our everyday technological experiences,LRTInteresting to observe that connectionism and Bayesian approaches are being revived in the era of hyper connectivity and big data,LRTIn that regard social media activities are great way to get over that feeling and realize your place within the research community,LRTIn my experience ve never seen anything but kindness and helpfulness in pointing out where others may have misunderstood something,LRTMy response was this is product of the impostor syndrome we all struggle with as early career scientists,LRTthink really important one many share is how do you get over worrying that someone will judge you negatively for what you share,LRTThere were some really nice questions after my talk on social media for scientists,LRTfind it can be difficult to write effectively if taking in too much new information Don worry normal service will resume shortly,LRTve shut off all RSS inflow for the next months while put some serious work in on publishing my current backlog,LRTIf anyone is wondering about the sudden drop off in paper tweets from me,LRTOr maybe just need to make an angry rant anon account,LRTBut am going to be more careful No more angry post review tweets OK maybe just few,LRTalso like to think my rants are based in actually sound science and theory,LRTAnyway ve got about metacognition papers on my plate before can get back to connectivity so oh well,LRTIt gets really interesting when we can use directed graphs but not sure either GCM or DCM are up for it,LRTlike to use the sliding window approach for example to plot time courses of modularity degree centrality etc,LRTNow that not running parallel experiments though analysis is going smooth Very excited to get this pile of stuff of my desk,LRTCan at least get some test data from HCP the real limitation is time As always,LRTHave lot of fun ideas for looking at global cortical hierarchies but need time good data set to play with and good collaborator,LRTve spent years mastering DCM in it various forms and basically sick of it ll still use it but need some exhaustive tools,LRTHappy to be almost finished analyzing all my metacognition and physiological data Then on to tonotopy,LRTSurprised to learn no one in the UK gives damn about being quiet on the silent train In Denmark there would be instant shushing,LRTvivid dream that Batman is lot of fun but not very restful,LRTOk time to take breather and go for nature walk while finish my talk

time points to model development,LRTExciting new study from estimating longitudinal trajectory from MRI mixed effects DCM for anatomy,LRTSome epic UK buskers,LRTThis paper has just consumed me and wasted so much time and energy this year It time to move on and do some science,LRTThanks to everyone who puts up with my crazy rants Will try to minimize in the future No more post rejection posts,LRTtried really really hard to not burn any bridges up to this point in my career,LRTIf you keep shortlist of important accounts you can follow very promiscuously and enjoy information firehose vs spigot,LRTgrew up in MUDs and chat rooms social media etc It all dynamic to me,LRTIf you are new to twitter and get overwhelmed by those of us who chat here just follow more people Use list to keep it manageable,LRTAlright sorry thanks for the rant needed it It not about the rejection but the idea that questioning it is somehow disrespect,LRTIt not our fault Profit principle warps everything and who can put price on self awareness,LRTwonder what can do for my encore,LRTZapped people with lasers found cool unconscious emotion finding and apparently pissed off an Editor In Chief the capitals matter,LRTToday has been interesting,LRTve got bully pulpit and goddamn if not going to use it,LRTwould have assumed it should be increased power but don really know this area,LRTCurrently having loads of fun adding some basic outlier rejection to EMG functions,LRTCoding analysis or experiments to strict deadline is nightmare The same on my own schedule is an absolute pleasure,LRTManuscript submitted Next,LRTAlright all my summer conferencing is done Time to wrap up final analyses and write like ve never written before,LRTPut another way arguing we only believe the no report paradigm becuase we have phenomenal experience of the paradigm itself ASSC,LRTASSC the no report paradigm has no application to the petri dish We have phenomenal experience that shores up belief in binocular riv,LRTWrt chalmers and the petri dish the only reason we believe the no report paradigm is because we have phenomenal experience of rivalry,LRTWilke no report paradigm allows us to not train the monkey for years and thus may be essential methodological technique ASSC,LRTIf only London wasn city for Bankers,LRTFor major research university the UCL neuroscience community feels like big family and proud to be part of it,LRTLately feeling conflicted about my future absolutely love UCL but don like London that much just rolling stone suppose,LRTMelanie Wilke up next on the no report paradigm ASSC,LRTBut remain about as unconvinced as ever that one can actually dissociate report from experience ASSC,LRTFr ssle gave great extremely pedagogical talk relatively convinced by the method but ASSC,LRTNice that the correlate of subjective report overlaps with areas implicated in metacognition by ASSC,LRTFr ssle OKN increases statistical power and changes topology of NCC ASSC,LRTWonder what that result looks like at more standard pFWE thresh Probably uncomfortably extensive assc,LRTUhhh Lots of kinda reliable in this part of the talk Pupil doesn look too reliable to me ASSC,LRTSuch fascinating talk How to measure experience without report the OKN technique ASSC,LRTreally need to turn of this mac thingy that sends me desktop notifications from twitter,LRTlists of cools things views Short takedown post on bad science amp counting ll take that as win for post pub peer review,LRTIt not my job to spend hours carefully explaining obvious flaws that was the reviewers,LRTAnd yeah my post is snarky but that paper is joke Scientists blogging is an off the cuff sport deal with it yo,LRTGrrrr anyway no time to do anything but tweet about it for now,LRTfundementally cross disciplinary researcher and am revolted by the idea that this somehow should allow for crap methodology,LRTThe author utterly ignores the issues with reverse inference and erroneous interaction,LRTTHE ENTIRE PAPER IS CENTERED AROUND CAUSAL CLAIMS,LRTThe effect clearly shows regression to the mean there nothing there,LRTIt not just about the value The study design is horrendous,LRTGreat to hear Susan Hurley work being discussed Was true leader amp cogsci suffered greatly from her loss ASSC,LRTdon see at all how seizure related inability to report is evidence for lack of consciousness ASSC,LRTTim Bayne speaking on levels of consciousness with prerequisite philosopher beard ASSC,LRTSounds lot like pain is an active inference to me assc,LRTExcited to be staying in nice AirBnB just minutes walk from assc venue minutes from the Louvre,LRTOverall very happy with my experience my preprint has already gt PDF downloads in days,LRTcannot seem to settle on decent twitter app Fenix was great for while but increasingly wonky and the official app is mess of ads,LRTAlso forget the hard problem what total era focus Enactivism is not solution and does not require one,LRTThough owe great intellectual debt to Varela enactivists focused on the wrong issues and ignored more pragmatic approach,LRTFor me then neurophenomenology is less the Buddhist Husserelian exercise imagined by Varela and more of an experimental approach,LRTNice insight in my work use predictive coding to generate mechanistic hypotheses and connectomics to biologically constrain them,LRTSo make sure you find us at ASSC if you want to know all about precision the bayesian brain and conscious inference,LRTtime for what hash tag we going with ASSC Excited,LRTSmallwood two explanatory targets cognitive Independence and representation endogenous vs evoked hubbubmw,LRTSmallwood spontaneous thought interesting because

of decay followed by implosion,LRTPersonally it past time for reddit to implode and be replaced far too corrupt with adds and eternal september,LRTwell we really are totally mean ignorant selfish and totally fucked beyond repair Time to push reset,LRTkinda think the net will be the catalyst that finally causes us to push all the big shiny red buttons connected to nuclear submarines,LRTWe really don want the horrible troll underbelly of the net to invade our nice little academic community here inevitable guess,LRTTim Hunt thing getting out of hand Feels like all need to step back and cool off bit before something insane happens Seriously worried,LRTReally loving all the tweets going no look at this post for walking related media hype Go twitter,LRTIf can finish up this script in next few hours might pen quick post on these thoughts Serves as study preregistration,LRTThis is why got on the PC bandwagon can literally think up experiments day with this stuff,LRTThis has been your weekly dose of Insula chat with Micah Allen Time to finish this script,LRTOne prediction would be that tactile pain interoceptive modalities should be more responsive to cue precision and show stronger learning,LRTalso keen to test my hypothesis that bodily modalities have higher priori expected precision than exteroceptive ones,LRTthink it pretty plausible hypothesis that AIC MCC monitor and integrate supra modal precision,LRTIn the future my work on this area will branch more into how different modalities are integrated via precision weighting,LRTIn dream world someday ll tweet study idea someone will run it and we ll collaborate on the paper,LRTWould need two or three electrodes on each side of the body but would be really cool experiment,LRTNice factorial there cue congruence and cue specificity If only had unlimited time and resources,LRTAnother interesting idea would be to cue each tactile stimulus with specific or vague body part like left index finger vs left side,LRTIn the future it would be very interesting to do similar task manipulating stimulus modality and precision Could be done with frequency,LRTKey finding the strength with which deviance modulates backwards MFG gt AIC connections predicts subjective ratings of switch detection,LRTKey finding posterior thalamus communicates tactile PE to both AIC amp which then couple together to drive rest of cortical response,LRTIt is relatively simple and straight forward research question but feel like it very solid experiment with clear result,LRTalways get tingles when new analysis pipeline is almost done Making speedy progress on my pupil GLMs thanks to help from,LRTAhh wrong link one moment,LRTExcept papers don get rejected from frontiers so who knows,LRTThe nature is good for your brain power spin BS whirlwind begins,LRTProductivity be damned blogging this steaming pile right now,LRTIn one snazzy package that paper encapsulates both reverse inference and erroneous interaction testing Any fishing for hat trick,LRTAny reason to choose PeerJ vs Biorxiv for my preprint article big fan of both projects which to support,LRTThis paper makes me think it generally ok in Elsevier journals,LRTCan upload preprint before submitting to Neuroimage Anyone know the policy on this What about SCAN,LRTalso deleted my RSS reader on my app so probably not going to be doing my daily paper tweets for while,LRTWe ve got to be maybe years away from looking back at doing it this way and laughing Like using an track in,LRTAlso really learned something about the value of true focus Now from write only and from code analyze only,LRTTrip helped me see the value in life beyond academia the need to do solid science as openly as possible,LRTFab first day back at work after much needed deep hiatus with full snorkeling regime Fresh perspective is liberating,LRTFor have seen the shores of hell that endless suburb beyond the peach orchards,LRTAnd that the value of this union will depend on how well the integrated theory predicts behavior versus the two individual approaches,LRTUltimately for me at least it is clear that modern PC is more closely aligned with enactivism interaction theory than theory theory or sim,LRTit remains to be seen whether enactivism commitment to strong externalism can be reconciled with the notion of active inference in PC,LRTWe find that while recent developments in PC clearly align with enactivism in emphasizing dynamic coordination over internal mentalism,LRTWe compare classical predictive coding and enactivist views of social cognition from pluralistic stand point,LRTLet the recent victories for the ACA and gay marriage remind us how much we stand to lose if the right wins the next election LoveWins,LRTWoop woop scotus rules against gay marriage bans great day in history for civil rights,LRTHello London Your feeling hot today year and half on still feels weird considering this home,LRTMaybe byproduct of our tendency to act incredibly excited about everything,LRTNot to deny there are some really novel ideas left out there to explore but think this person was correct Careful work needed now,LRTOnce publication reform washes away the Glamour Mag monopoly the high water will recede and only quality papers will stand out,LRTEven if you can still publish your magical regression gt silly human trick high impact few believe these results,LRTHad great conversation at ohbm about next big thing impact and novelty in neuroscience,LRTEthics is selling bad neurobuisness to idiots who use it to bilk other idiots out of money unethical could be neuro robinhood,LRTGotta love the one bro science life coach dude yelling at us all to come join neurobusiness Sure thing wheres my consult fee tho,LRTshould tweet like this when get new results,LRTCheck out my cool new science hat Mauna Kea was awesome next time we ll have to go at night,LRTGoodbye beautiful Hawaii Back to work Publish or dont visit tropical paradise,LRTThe big island is amazing Bliss,LRTWill be tweeting some of my favorite for better or for worse OHBM posters over the next few days Stay tuned,LRTCome hear how the AIC communicates tactile prediction error throughout the cortical hierarchy at my poster today OHBM,LRTOff to the HBM party soon Would be nice to catch the gala as well were is it,LRTSome great auditory PRF work by De Martino tighter tuning in LC than cortex OHBM,LRTDenison ability to get better results with less data using important for patient studies OHBM,LRTRachel Denison now on vision

confused by CSF swirling and low res Good news for OHBM,LRTWald multislice approach can help to overcome major coverage limits at with no downsides OHBM,LRTWyss concludes by emphasizing optimal sequence depends heavily on what structure your interested in OHBM,LRTThat was one hell of neuroporn talk Great overview of what possible at by Wyss OHBM,LRTbrings big challenges for imaging already difficult areas near air cavities OHBM,LRTMichael Wyss on imaging the brainstem at OHBM,LRTSWG magnitude of anti correlations extremely functionally relevant or you know mathematical artifact of GSR OHBM,LRTguess the focus here is really on practical application and at least predictive validity and classification accuracy have some value there,LRTWhat the official hashtag for HBM OHBM seems dead,LRTOn my way to Honolulu with and for OHBM Let me know if you want to meet up,LRTPacific highway one Basically heaven So good it makes you reevaluate your life Why did leave California,LRTOn my way to California and Hawaii for some honeymooning and conferencing with Buon viaggio,LRTFun times hanging out with talking predictive coding and consciousness,LRTRough draft of my tactile prediction error and AIC poster come see me present it at OHBM,LRTThe chipotle flat iron steak chili made in my slow cooker last night is so damn good considering it for breakfast,LRTThere is certain irony in being unable to sleep because writing about mind wandering,LRTEasy flowing writing and inspiration how have missed you,LRTYES Finally woke myself up at am with insight rushed to keyboard and jammed out half an introduction in sitting Muse is back baby,LRTmight be bit slow but always get there in the end ll focus on the quality and let the world sort em out,LRTOh god why did accept to try the new Google Inbox hate it Hate it It terribad,LRTLesson is if you are gonna give boobadvice do it with care,LRTMany of the core areas of that system are also important for basic bodily awareness,LRTOnce ve got my new physio and pRF pipelines built it manuscript city baby,LRTSeems like the author tried to make worthwhile point trip fell and said some really stupid stuff she ll regret today,LRTWhen did we start using information theory in neuroscience,LRTRan neat experiment recently that seems to be null Good venue for writing it up PLOS ONE PeerJ new consciousness journal,LRTOn the docket this month ve got neuroimage submission two blog posts an overdue review and an HBM poster,LRTWedding done Last family member leaves Europe tomorrow Thus begins the greatest work sprint of my life submissions by December or bust,LRTThe Case for Computational Functionalism,LRTCongrats Nahid Zokaei awarded British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship,LRTThank so much everyone

brilliant and lovely,LRTsad but important reality that decades of organization amp investment in social rights amp goods wiped away in single night of privatization,LRTJust musing on it don think there is any real cause for concern here unless maybe authors promoting ridiculous claims,LRTIf priors are refined over evolutionary timescales we should be able to locate hierarchy of expected precision across the brain,LRTWhen you watch video like that the innate coupling of intero and extero perception is fairly obvious,LRTYour daily dose of vicarious interoceptive freakout,LRTGreat time in York at BBQ celebrating ERC Grant Go Jonny,LRTHuge discussion in the one hour was shopping for my wedding rings Got to hope train to York will catch up soon,LRTSurely that would inflate my

theory but at some point you have to ask who the information is for,LRTAll of you come to the damn pub and lets debate some information theory and philosophy of mind Surely that exists in London,LRTTrying to have an interesting way philosophical discussion on crappy wifi through twitter is like threading needle with gloves,LRTSo then the question is how can there be information in the brain who is there to observe it,LRTSurely if we imagine hypothetical world with no observers but with telegraph lines there is no information to be found,LRTAs in the transmission of and along line only has meaning insofar as encoded message that is mutually understood by reciever,LRTSorta following Searle have often wondered if information doesn imply the necessity of an observer,LRTOK here goes some random philosophy of mind that probably makes no sense,LRTFirst year in London was like oh god this city sucks But think starting to get hooked Scary,LRTguess pain is one Startle probes Really nasty images Cold pressor task Physical exertion,LRTAlong the same lines what are some robust ways to exogenously increase arousal,LRTcould one get away with say startle trials intermixed in non startle,LRTAre startle probes suitable for repetitive event related designs could run startle probe trials or will rep suppr interfere,LRTSeems to be function of having long

registration is done solely through paypal hate paypal,LRTprinciple reason came to the is emphasis here on moving beyond data features blobs erps to modelling underlying dynamics,LRTIt would be really funny if after dumping billion into Minecraft the internet just collectively lost interest and abandoned it,LRTHas to be one hell of story there,LRTIt is going to be lot of fun someday in the future when running lab full of cyborg brats and we re tearing it up on the infonets,LRTRich searchable and sort able scientific metadata probably worth more than most of the paper content to begin with,LRTSome big thinkers in brain science Friston Buszaski Sporns and Tononi,LRTThis is similar to how read so lets see if it pays off or fails miserably,LRTThat way wherever am whenever get few words of inspiration can move them all forward,LRTtrying new strategy of starting all of these manuscripts at the same time in Drive and just filling in bits and pieces every day,LRTFigured out today ve got approximately planned new manuscripts for this year Totally doable right,LRTMy new avatar doesn feature brain Can you deal with that twitter,LRTOn my way to York for much needed dose of

calls to mind the art of Chesley Bonestell Ice climbing anyone,HRTDazzling details in Saturn northern hemisphere brought to you by our cameras on Cassini,HRTHaumea was announced yrs ago yesterday fastest spinning large body in solar system Multiple moons Family of collisional fragments Wow,HRTMakemake was announced on the same day as Eris years ago Surface is covered in slabs of methane Awesome place Let go,HRTThings we ve learned If Eris had been at its closest point to the sun Clyde Tombaugh would likely have discovered it yrs ago,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs its surface reflects almost of the sunlight that hits it because of that frozen atmosphere,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs its orbit is inclined by degrees to the plane of the planets Which still doesn make sense,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has satellite Dysnomia that we think was formed in giant impact Maybe,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs it is much more massive than Pluto yet tiny bit smaller thus much rockier on the inside,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has very Pluto like surface composition though at the distance the atmosphere is frozen,HRThate to be the voice of Pluto sobriety or any sobriety but that whole Pluto atmosphere has collapsed in year thing smells fishy,HRTOther places likely to have cool CH flows Makemake Eris Quaoar OR Fun to see Pluto to better understand these too,HRTIn my view the ice flows are the coolest things found on Pluto so far Still want more Charon though,HRTJust interview by BBC presenter about Kepler who said look haven we more or less heard all of this before And um yeah kinda,HRTAh Plenty of craters on Pluto where they re not covered by ices Which is of course what was expected all along,HRTHaze in the craters of Ceres OK That counts as awesome,HRTHappy to see my favorite wikipedia dwarf planet image updated so quickly,HRTOK Pluto That was fun Now back to work Today Europa Trojan asteroids And super secret project with the code name Phattie,HRTAwesomeness,HRTAlso worth noting that geologically active generally means interior rumblings Clearly frosts move around on Pluto surface,HRTIn current hallway conversations with planetary scientists most are unconvinced by the evidence that Pluto is geologically active,HRTok hard to argue with this one,HRTSure it OK to grandfather Pluto in as planet Also you can grandfather the Earth as flat too if that makes you feel better,HRTIf you re local amp looking for place to geek out on Pluto tonight come to the Planetary Society event in Pasadena,HRTEvery time someone says Pluto looks really interesting thus should be planet Titan sheds an alkane tear,HRTOr maybe not Figuring out if that is plausible requires getting out the pencil and doing calculations Which too sleepy to do now,HRTequatorial ice melting decades earlier Once it starts it spreads around the equator Leaving the heart for last,HRTIs it coincidence that the heart is on the anti Charon side Maybe light from Charon provided just enough extra heat to start the,HRTMy best is that if you came back in years the heart would be gone which sounds kind of sad and dark regions would extend further,HRTBUT the bright patch really shouldnt be at the equator That one of the warmest spots The rest of the equator is ice free as expected,HRTNot surprising to have ice patches coming and going Pluto goes through seasonal temperature extremes so that is expected,HRTThat heart on Pluto sure is odd It appears to be thick ice patch that is being slowing eaten away at the edges,HRTAlso the dark patch at Charon north pole definitely looks more interesting than initially gave it credit for,HRTOhhh crater rays on Charon Awesome And might the tiny white splotches be my ice volcanoes want ice volcanoes,HRTUseful to keep in mind Pluto size and density in the context of other objects from the Kuiper belt,HRTHey so is it too early to suggest that the big heart on Pluto whatever it turns out to be be named Tombaugh,HRTBack in offered these thoughts on the critical question of whether Eris or Pluto is bigger on,HRTOdd that Eris is tiny bit smaller than Pluto but so much more massive They are quite different bodies in many ways Maybe we should go,HRTgood sign would be that Charon pole is not just darker but also red think we ll get color info soon,HRTmonth ago suggested Charon would look like Uranus moon Ariel Similarities pretty good so far,HRTHere figure from that Hansen amp Paige paper showing how Pluto surface ices move around with time,HRTOn Charon the brightest spots are likely to be ammonia rich water ice flows Dark spots not dark just lack of water flows,HRTThe heart could just be random feedback It bright so reflects sunlight so cold so gets icy gets brighter gets colder etc,HRTWhy is the dark equatorial band not continuous No clue The heart looks like the brightest spot on the surface and its equatorial,HRTdark substrate behind Dark substrate is probably tholins Tholins organic muck sorry,HRTby Hansen and Paige who showed how nitrogen evaporates from the warm equatorial regions and reaccumulates at the poles leaving cont,HRTThe dominant feature on Pluto is the dark but not quite continuous equatorial band This was nicely explained in in paper cont,HRTOK friends the Pluto and Charon images are good enough for new round of speculation Let start here,HRTThe latest Pluto images remind me of early adaptive optics images of Titan totally cool and thoroughly uninterpretable Soon though Soon,HRTJust back from vacation What all of this Pluto stuff everyone is talking about,HRTBiggest Pluto surprise to me so far is that New Horizons still hasn spotted any new moons have bet yes,HRTso far nothing on pluto Charon to be surprised about But images are quickly getting better Stay tuned,HRTCharon looks grayer because it too small to keep nitrogen or methane from escaping so only has old water ice on its surface,HRTpeach relatively fresh methane starting to degrade Dark old warm ice free degraded methane,HRTon Pluto darker spots get warmer drove off ices get warmer still drive off more ices etc etc So white cold nitrogen ice,HRTmethane breaks apart and turns reddish when exposed to sunlight and space Pluto is patchy probably because of feedback,HRTTime for your periodic Pluto speculations So far all is as expected Pluto is peach colored because of methane,HRTHappy AsteroidDay day on which you should ponder just how full of crap the people are who are trying to scare you about asteroids,HRTPluto likely mottled because of surface feedback slightly darker areas get warmer drive off ices get darker get warmer get darker,HRTWhere do ice flows on Charon come from The ancient interior ocean now frozen out but once erupting onto the surface,HRTDark polar cap on Charon Unlikely to be dark ice frost cap but rather lack of bright stuff What is bright stuff Ice flows,HRTQuaoar Named after the Tongva tribe creation deity who sang and danced the world into existence lt Quaoar,HRTIn case you were worried actually like the real non planet Pluto,HRTICYMI my speculations yesterday on the latest Pluto images have been Storyfyed,HRTAs of today the silly term Plutoid has been used in precisely zero titles or abstracts of refereed papers,HRTHold still Europa You re being analyzed this won hurt bit,HRTDear Europa we are about to spy on you We will learn your secrets We are like the NSA of the Jupiter system xoxoxo,HRTNASA might go to Europa within the next decade Me amp the Keck telescope are going there in about hours,HRTEvery time someone says dwarf planet must be planet because of the name seahorse somewhere sheds salty tear,HRTBeautiful Widmanstatten pattern in this iron meteorite Pattern only forms in frozen cores of mini worlds,HRTThe core mantle boundary of shattered mini world Thanks mini world Sorry about the shattering pallasite,HRTThis No big deal it just PIECE OF THE MOON,HRTOK so the white spots on Ceres are dramatic and mysterious but check out all of those near global scale ridges too,HRTNice byproduct of observing Europa with Keck is this sweet little image of Jupiter in the guide camera,HRTAMA on Reddit minutes,HRTdoing Reddit AMA on Saturday So you can ask me anything Really Anything at all Wide open Just not about Pluto OK Deal Promise,HRThave theory that using ice from the dark trailing side of Europa would result in the best gin amp tonic ever like to test that idea,HRTThis sounds like it might be really good deal to me Wonder if it ever goes on sale though,HRTThis Pluto musical almost makes me feel sad for Pluto But Nahhhhhh,HRTGalileo hacked my data Claimed credit,HRTAnyone wonder why all of those bright dwarf planets were discovered yrs ago and nothing much since explain,HRTyrs ago today we discovered Makemake the nd brightest KBO after Pluto It was unsurprisingly nicknamed Easterbunny for awhile,HRTMy free online Science of the Solar System has now begun Students from every continent except Antarctica Anyone there like

couple of times decade Which makes it like California only colder And with methane,HRTToo sleepy to tweet it last night but as seen from Keck Titan weather report Yesterday partly cloudy little chance of methane rain,HRTEuropa question for tonight where exactly is all of that hydrogen peroxide coming from We might know the answer in about an hour,HRTMe on Ceres The images now are just at

spherical asteroid no,HRTYou might be glad to know that we are done with Uranus for the evening ahem,HRTUranus rotates fast one of the storms is nearly off the limb already,HRTThe two bright dots on the faint disk are storms on Uranus with clouds high that sunlight reflects before being absorbed by methane,HRTIn the infrared Uranus is nearly invisible because of methane absorption but the faint rings still reflect sunlight,HRTReading on the current state of NASA It depressing to read even if you know it already,HRTKeck still closed the Europa eclipse we came to see is lost But we took out an Dobs and watched in real life Cause that how we roll,HRTWhoo hoo The winds are blowing so hard on Mauna Kea that the Keck telescope just blew sideways Um literally Closing for

watching the last bit of shipwreck go under,HRTWow NASA is currently have Town Hall meeting and essentially telling planetary scientists to look for new jobs Wow,HRTSeriously good If you re curious about who is planet and who is not and why you should go read this now,HRTWanna see comet ISON Keep an eye on this live camera from the summit of Mauna Kea over the next minutes,HRTIn astronomy
