website please note the image is CIVA Philae ESA,LRTOne of those reasons is that my cameras don point in the same direction So if OSIRIS can see something can,LRTdon take as many pictures as OSIRIS does aboard my mothership Rosetta There are several reasons for this,LRTam now just million km from the comet going to land on in and getting closer all the time now,LRTll do it first though

subsystem has harpoons to hold me down securely on the comet surface after landing PhilaeThursday,LRTMy ADS thruster can also give me small push towards the comet during descent reducing the descent time PhilaeThursday,LRTThis is because the comet is so small its gravity is very weak don want to bounce off into space back after landing PhilaeThursday,LRTUnlike landing on planet where thrusters may be used to slow down lander my thruster will push me down ONTO the comet PhilaeThursday,LRTThe first of my subsystems alphabetically is the Active Descent System or ADS which has Nitrogen gas thruster PhilaeThursday,LRTof my subsystems were built using advanced technology from crashed alien spacecraft Yes even spacecraft enjoy aprilfools day,LRThave subsystems and am carrying experiment

PhilaeThursday,LRTCongrats to the Stardust NExT team on their flyby of comet Tempel,LRTThe distance between me and the Earth is actually decreasing at the moment can anybody guess why,LRTmy clever science team are still busy analyzing possible descents for me at the comet can safely land at up to km PhilaeThursday,LRTupdate is little late this week sorry,LRTHappy Birthday to my Project Manager Stephan Ulamec PhilaeThursday,LRTRosetta is performing series of thruster burns tweaking our course to the comet Read more at PhilaeThursday,LRTcan talk to my ground controllers directly Rosetta passes my messages to Earth with its powerful antenna vice versa PhilaeThursday,LRTThe check out is over have started my long Hibernation Phase on DOY Dec at UTC zzzzzzzz,LRTlanded safely Well not really but the Separation Descent Landing test went perfectly Comet here come,LRTcheckout is going well ve had new version of my flight software uploaded and am now preparing to rehearse the landing,LRTst block of tests went well all experiments working well My ground engineers are also testing my behaviour at low temps brr,LRTSpecial PhilaeThursday here today ve been switched on for the final checkout of my units and systems before hibernation until,LRTMy ground engineers are busy preparing for PC the last chance to checkout my systems and instruments until PhilaeThursday,LRTcontinued The change came when my launch was delayed by year and my planned route to Wirtanen became impossible PhilaeThursday,LRTAlthough am flying towards comet Churyumov Gerasimenko was originally designed to land on comet Wirtanen PhilaeThursday,LRTam being carried by the Rosetta probe My name comes from temple in Egypt closely associated with the Rosetta stone

couple days get ready to get even more stoked about the mission,LRTIs there life on planets around other stars Read story in rhyme about girl on planet hunt,LRTAlso WASP which has the distinction of being the first dying planet found it got mil yrs before SMACK right into its star,LRTMeanwhile CoRoT has discovered the first confirmed terrestrial exoplanet It one of two super Earth size planets that orbit the star,LRTOk back and the planet news has piled up For starters cross WASP off the exoplanet list looks like it actually binary star,LRTWild week for exoplanets first there was the planet train wreck discovered by Spitzer,LRTIn this case is roasting hot Jupiter with day orbit and is portly xJupiter mass planet with super eccentric orbit,LRTHAT and have people pretty excited it the first time multi planet system with one transiting planet has been discovered,LRTAnother new one HD is little bit smaller Jup masses and has pretty eccentric egg shaped orbit around its star,LRTNew planets HD is whopping Jupiter mass planet with year about days longer than Earth Massive,LRTAnybody checked out Greg Laughlin blog at oklo org It dope well written cool photos and lots of stuff to ponder,LRTAlso had some folks announce that they observed the phases of an exoplanet as it orbited in front of and then behind its host star whoa,LRTPlanetQuest isn dead We ve had few new planet additions and some interesting finds like an exoplanet in Andromeda maybe,LRTIt been quiet lately but here some big news astronomers find planets using astrometry for the first time way cool,LRTProps to everyone who came to the JPL Open House Esp the RoboDome line survivors little video from inside the dome,LRTFun fact HAT transit was also detected by an amateur astronomer in Portugal lots of people getting in on the planet hunt,LRTNew planet HAT is sub Saturn size planet orbiting in scorching day orbit,LRTIf you re in SoCal this weekend come check out the free JPL open house See cool stuff talk to scientists visit the legendary ROBODOME,LRTThat not all HD is gas giant planet with an eccentric orbit that takes it as close as Mercury to our sun and farther than Mars,LRTReply The waterworld theory is based on its orbit and models that predict lots of ice water on its surface just guess for now,LRTSo to sum up Gliese Kamino maybe Gliese Mustafar maybe Confused handy reference,LRTThe same team has also found that sister planet Gliese may actually be in its star habitable zone and could be an ocean planet,LRTThis just in Gliese is just the size of the Earth and is the smallest exoplanet yet discovered It could possibly terrestrial,LRTKepler first light images are up WOOT Check em out Let hope plenty of Earths are hiding in that starfield,LRTKepler will start collecting scientific data in few weeks so far so good,LRTThe Kepler dust cover was ejected successfully Scientists now know what kind of background noise to subtract from the science data,LRTOK scratch that last post the dust cover will be ejected in about an hour at the earliest sorry for the confusion,LRTKepler dust cover is scheduled to be ejected in about an hour at the latest,LRTGet stoked for hours of Astronomy Some cool stuff like Kepler and Spitzer webcasts or the chance get to control remote telescope,LRTThe other new planet is also in constellation Draco HD is hefty Jupiter size gas giant with an day orbit,LRTWell it been pretty quiet lately but finally we have some new planets Dra is gas giant orbiting sun size star at about AU,LRTKepler has launched Right on Everything seems to be going well so far nearly minutes into the flight,LRTThis planet was teased out of previously existing radial velocity data for HD using Bayesian analysis,LRTGas giant HD is little smaller than Jupiter with pretty eccentric orbit that averages about AU from its host star,LRTPlanet Alert Not much info on CoRoT Exo yet but it appears to be Hot Jupiter type with very close day orbit around its star,LRTInterestingly they have mean motion resonance meaning that over the same amount of time one planet makes orbits the other,LRTCouple new planets announced today HD and are gas giants that orbit at about and AU respectively eccentric orbits too,LRTDespite what you may have read the new planet is NOT confirmed to be the smallest in mass discovered it about times Earth mass,LRTHot new planet COROT Exo is the first transiting super Earth and maybe the first terrestrial planet found It about Earth size,LRTNew Super Earth discovered HD is about the size of Earth but with tiny day orbit around its star Bring the sunblock,LRTScientists using Spitzer have just seen an exoplanet with wild orbit heat up over in just over six hours Deets,LRTQuestions about exoplanets Bring em on,LRTScientists estimate the size of MOA BLG Lb to be about Earth masses still pretty small but not quite as much as was reported,LRTHeads up the Earth size planet reported yesterday was false alarm some confusion between couple of reports,LRTKepler going to watch the sky for few years looking for transiting exoplanets and letting us know just how many Earths might be nearby,LRTJust days until the launch of the Kepler mission get excited We ve got countdown and mission info at planetquest jpl nasa gov,LRTAnd the planet train keeps on rolling HD is about Jup size and has year almost as long as ours at days,LRTFirst new planet of HAT is almost Jup size with toasty day orbit located in the Cygnus constellation,LRTHD on the other hand is just over half Jupiter mass and takes just about Earth years to make its orbit we re up to now,LRTNew planets for the weekend HD is about Jup mass and take about Earth years to orbit its star,LRTOGLE TR is an even bigger closer roaster Jup size with an even tighter day orbit it no place to spend the holidays,LRTNew planets HAT is hot Jupiter type planet that about Jup size and has quick day orbit time another roaster,LRTPlanet portraits keep rolling in French astronomers managed to snap pic of planet orbiting the bright star beta Pic,LRTIts sister planet HD is bit bigger Jup size and orbits farther away AU albeit with pretty eccentric orbit,LRTAnd the planet train doesn stop HD is about the size of Jup and snuggles right up to its host star with an day orbit,LRTSo we re up to planets discovered but more importantly we finally have visible light images of exoplanets Christmas comes early,LRTAnd finally HR orbits at AU and sits about AU from its star Both HD and Fomalhaut are visible from Earth stars only,LRTHR is another big ol gas giant Jup size orbiting its star at distance of AU That makes for day long year,LRTOne of the trio of planets that was imaged HR is about Jupiter size and orbits hefty AU from its host also blue star,LRTOne of the imaged planets Fomalhaut is no bigger than Jupiter size It orbits about AU from its host young blue star,LRTHere another link with better picture of the three planets discovered from the ground,LRTAnd it doesn stop there Scientists also managed to snap pics of more from the GROUND wow Check it out,LRTHubble has snapped one of the first pictures of an exoplanet Take look here,LRTBIG exoplanet news coming up later today Stay tuned,LRTSo now we re up to planets These latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky using the radial velocity method,LRTNow this is big one HD is Jupiter size and has really odd eccentric orbit Planet or brown dwarf It not clear yet,LRTHD is Jupiter mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was Earth orbits from our Sun,LRTCorrection to the last post planet name is HD Yet another poetic exoplanet moniker,LRTHalloween planets HD is gas giant about the size of Jupiter with an orbit about as far out from its star as Mars is,LRTThat makes new planets discovered and brings our planet count to Get the fine details on these cool new worlds at,LRTHD is gas giant with super eccentric orbit if it orbited our sun it would swing from closer than Mercury to farther than Mars,LRTHD is massive planet the size of Jupiter It has very eccentric orbit that takes it days to complete,LRTHD is the size of Jupiter with an orbit of days around star just hotter than our sun about as long as Mars year,LRTBD is big ol Jupiter size planet with pretty eccentric day orbit around its small star,LRTLots of new planets to announce HD is almost the size of Jupiter and orbits about half an AU from sunlike star,LRTLupus TR is back on the list new evidence shows it planet This is Jupiter size world that only AU from its star Hot,LRTLooks like Lupus TR might actually be part of multiple star and not actually planet so we re dropping it from the count for now,LRTWeird COROT exo is the size of Jupiter but its mass Scientists aren yet sure just what it actually is Link,LRTLooks like the HAT and WASP teams found the same planet at the same time So now it called HAT WASP and the count is back to,LRTThis actually just refers to extrasolar planets not in our own solar system good question,LRTFor those keeping score this brings us up to planets discovered and multi planet solar systems so far it busy neighborhood,LRTAnd HD is more than the size of Jupiter and orbits its star about as far away as Mars is from our sun,LRTLooks like today triple play for new planets HD is just about the size of Jupiter and orbits at abou AU from its star,LRTNew planet added today CT Cha crams Jup masses into planet just times as big and orbiting AU possibly brown dwarf,LRTMOA BLG was discovered using gravitational lensing an exotic way to hunt for planets using light bent by the gravity from stars,LRTNew planet for Talk Like Pirate Day Not much info yet about MOA BLG it about the size of Jupiter and AU from its star,LRTIt been busy week for planet hunters new gas giants announced and one retracted for total count of exoplanets discovered,LRTNASA has announced the Carl Sagan Fellowships in Exoplanet Exploration The stipend will be year to selected postdocs,LRTRemember to see the stats for any of these planets just visit and type in the name of the planet,LRTTW Hydrae has been dropped from the atlas due to findings that it might have been detection of stellar spots instead,LRTAnd one more HD which is about the size of Jupiter AU from its star which is just about Sun size Big planet,LRTHD was also announced it times the size of Jupiter and orbits about AU from its star which is the size of the sun,LRTAt long last we have some new planet updates GJ is about half the size of Jupiter and orbits AU from its tiny host star,LRTNew story on planetquest jpl nasa gov Backyard planet hunting Amateur astronomers join the exoplanet race,LRTNew BIG planet And is light years away times the mass of Jupiter and has day

Volunteers got to smell crushed ants for science by,LRTHow greyscale in GoT is kind of like leprosy,LRTWays the Civil War changed military medicine by,LRTThe firefly meet market by on the citizensci firefly project,LRTThis exaclty encapsulates my feelings via,LRTCan you train your velociraptor with clicker method like dog The important questions,LRTDoesn matter what the question is The answer is eating Mars bar for dinner,LRTAppendicitis may not need automatic surgery antibiotics could work just as well Could have saved my appendix,LRTAnd blaming it on age dude we can all learn new tricks Clear his remarks have history,LRTAnd not sure agree with this Just bc people don come forward doesn mean they aren there,LRTSo great to see while she in town And she brought me Mars bars because she is the BEST,LRTPrev link via,LRTMongooses know how NOT to keep it in the family,LRTLady mice can block the scent of man,LRTDefinitely worth knowing about Bad bird flu still spreading,LRTjust got signed copy of boo at the SFO airport How did even get that lucky bounce,LRTBold relentless experimentation with integrity is going to have to be our lodestar WCSJ,LRTBest sites are enduring funders don influence the journalists We need those firewall policies WCSJ,LRTalso references and says older groups like becoming more sure footed WCSJ,LRTSomething similar may be happening at now building capacity to do deep work WCSJ,LRTSome formerly cut rate places are now raising their game doing good journalism says referring to WCSJ,LRTThere at least three hopeful responses underway None are ideal But they giving us good digital journalism WCSJ,LRTrd problem with audience atomization is it creates opportunities for mischief by special interest groups WCSJ,LRTCross cultural conversations are being stifled by this atomization of interest WCSJ,LRTBut even as we are converging in multimedia tools we are diverging in our content Easy to build information bubble WCSJ,LRTIt time when they can tell more transparent vivid contextual stories WCSJ,LRTIncreasingly think the same media convergence will be occurring all over the world WCSJ,LRTIt all sounds pretty grim and yet there are reasons not to lose hope WCSJ,LRTThe emergence of the Internet only made us more confident we thought we knew what tank man wanted WCSJ,LRTremembers the incident at Tiananmen Square We know about it because there were journalists there WCSJ,LRTnotes that he knows the US best and apologizes for any bias in the talk WCSJ,LRTwants to step back and look at the big picture How did we get here Where are we going WCSJ,LRTNow hearing talk at WCSJ Squee Someday ll get brave enough to introduce myself,LRTNow final statement fill voids and feed curiosity Grow your own voice WCSJ,LRTMarie Pier Elie never be satisfied Keep digging WCSJ,LRTShow people what you are doing as you do it with Instagram etc get people excited before story comes out WCSJ,LRTSometimes words aren enough comics can be powerful media says WCSJ,LRTdid piece on einsteins visit to Argentina to promote it he tweeted like he was at the visit in WCSJ,LRThas strategies using fiction to capture attention and spark imagination WCSJ,LRTsays you have to punch through the pseudoscience How do you get through the noise WCSJ have to be interesting,LRTtalks about blending science and sci fi Like this WCSJ,LRTNow on strategies for digital storytelling WCSJ,LRTMarie tells the story of one camera crew that tried to manufacture fight between scientists Yikes WCSJ,LRTHighlight the human element to help viewers feel their motivations But again it rigor Marie says WCSJ,LRTMany scientists do much better when they think the camera is off Marie says Basic questions help too WCSJ,LRTHow do you find interviewees who are both knowledgable and charismatic Marie says pretty rare Knowledgeability is mandatory WCSJ,LRTWe only have to find what is sexy in science It not about forcing sexy on top of science says Marie WCSJ,LRTMarie says what you decide not to tell if just as important as what you decide to tell Do pruning for the relevant information WCSJ,LRTBut entertainment without rigor is even worse WCSJ how do you build narrative for audience with limited attention span,LRTNOW Marie Pier Elie Notes that rigor without any entertainment is no good in TV WCSJ,LRTEmilie says she was writing about cosmic rays and an observatory Turns out observatory was too small WCSJ,LRTOh sorry Current comments are from Emilie Martin their name plaques are mixed up WCSJ,LRTScientist complained there was too much human factor and not enough science WCSJ,LRTShe ended up writing about how people lived at the research station who they were etc WCSJ the scientist hated it,LRTMarie Piere Elie says she went to see scientists finding auroras but had no luck with the science WCSJ,LRTNow in entertainment and rigor can they coexist WCSJ,LRTLunch at WCSJ Lovely presentation,LRTlooks to the background for previous studies on the topic and looks up those people WCSJ,LRTWe get excited about positive results but every drug has side effects WCSJ,LRTWhen it comes to numbers show don tell says van Maaren Most ppl don know percentages WCSJ,LRTYour editor may say hey want this story It ok to look for other alternative angles Like teen author WCSJ,LRTWho will benefit from these findings Do lot of people have this disease Keep disease mongering in mind WCSJ,LRTAsk were you going on fishing expedition Hunting around to find significant things WCSJ,LRTWhat kind of study was it Observational Controlled trial WCSJ,LRTVan Maanen recommends getting into uni library for paper access But know this can be tough call for many WCSJ,LRTWe ve all gotten used to not trusting corp press releases academic ones have issues too WCSJ,LRTof the time you can find the limitations listed in the paper Some journals put it right in the abstract WCSJ,LRTBut in terms of timing and focus for ebola coverage Not so great Alarm didn grow Til late WCSJ,LRTDid you all do good job covering ebola on balance yes leveraged fear in responsible way WCSJ,LRTNow Oliver Yun from MSF to talk about ebola WCSJ,LRTwas very worried about infection had no insurance WCSJ,LRTIn June there wasn really western interest in ebola WCSJ,LRThas video of an ebola burial There was no dignity WCSJ,LRTUmaru says on the way home to Sierra Leone he going to be quarantined for two weeks for MERS think hes joking hope WCSJ,LRTDidn anticipate how difficult coming home would be Friends and coworkers don want to see you Ouch WCSJ,LRTsays life did continue normally People weren running around screaming WCSJ,LRTthings swung the pendulum the outbreak got worse and public health in Canada sent scientists Local bit helped WCSJ,LRTWorried about being strain on the resources about being the group to bring ebola back to Canada WCSJ,LRTsays tough to get to Africa for ebola trying to get the budget was tough and fear was factor WCSJ,LRTsniff no tea or coffee before session still none Didn get breakfast and now paying the price WCSJ,LRTNeed to be extremely rigorous with everything it not always going to be wrong but you ll know if problematic WCSJ,LRTWants to bring back muckrakers place for sci journos to deliver stories about what really going on WCSJ,LRTThat explosion of science pages was wonder of science moment but because easily expendable WCSJ,LRTsays yes at the end of the day you do need to eat and that ok need to be very transparent WCSJ,LRTQuestion as newspaper sections close people move to being PIOs what do you think of this WCSJ,LRTagrees it rough they have an investigative bureau in their uni By raising they fund journalists WCSJ,LRTNow questions Sci journos are being let go how do we fund the journalism you want to see WCSJ,LRTnow asking how much money we are following There may not be anything wrong but we should be able to see WCSJ,LRTThen there the watchdog role who is scrutinizing the way the govt spends money WCSJ,LRTnow covering fraud and misconduct and statistics says we don know how deep the iceberg is WCSJ,LRTSo peer review can be problematic when pressed for time and not able to do it properly WCSJ,LRTWho giving me the quality control had to had to work it out WCSJ on learning how to peer review,LRTwas torn wanted to do it properly and that takes time WCSJ,LRTsays where the accountability There no transparency WCSJ,LRTNow talking about the stem cell debacle asked for the peer review of the paper WCSJ couldn get it,LRTWe know these problem with replication if the foundations are shaky the results aren solid WCSJ,LRTAs result of the pressure science is under its trying to increase boundaries communicate more WCSJ,LRTnow talking about boundary theory When there are pressures sci needs to hold boundaries by communicating WCSJ,LRTnow taking about science media center in the uk which controls access to science info WCSJ,LRTIt about the ideology of being journalists and the tensions we feel in trying to be everything WCSJ,LRTSo say science journalists are acting as modest witnesses as well but Donna Harraway says we have no right WCSJ,LRTquotes about approaching things from many angles WCSJ,LRTis comparing science journalism to hamlet specifically hamlets ghost WCSJ,LRTAudience members says most journos are freelancers not enough scandals to make living WCSJ,LRTAudience members says focusing too much on scandals will lead to that being only thing covered More interesting things happen WCSJ,LRTFinal question should sci journalists work harder to expose frauds and scandals WCSJ,LRTAudience says it should be more society Science is important to society So we need that WCSJ,LRTMartin says we aren just about fraud and scandals we need to educate and communicate as well WCSJ,LRTAudience member says lead with the facts He doesn need human angle other people have that WCSJ,LRTThe right story is one that does both inform and talk about responding so this is about angles WCSJ,LRTviruses biology isn news How korea responds is news WCSJ,LRTSays if you are telling people whether or not to be scared you may feed into hype WCSJ,LRTMark says he write about biology when he in NYC but here he on the ground He can interview people MERS WCSJ,LRTOthers says they want to know about the virus first and should they be scared WCSJ,LRTAnother says it the way you present the story You use people reaction to go into what the virus is WCSJ,LRTMartin says she wants to know the basics before she wants to know the social implications WCSJ,LRTThe next question is my MERS story tomorrow would be mostly on WCSJ,LRTNow with the Internet things have changed Our stories are interesting and we can count how many people care WCSJ,LRTOn to the next question do science journalists feel disrespected by other journalists WCSJ,LRTWhere is the critical deficit Resources to practice journalism WCSJ,LRTFagin says what we need to reinforce is the journalism Says unis etc have their own ways to disseminate info WCSJ,LRTSays with limited amount of resources they need the facts not an angle that make scientists look like bad guys WCSJ,LRTSays we need more journalism to keep our hamburgers alive WCSJ,LRTAudience member says young science journalists lack ability to pitch with structure Need more journalism WCSJ,LRTSays he dislikes the use of lay people and says it condescending WCSJ,LRTWhen there new planet do we need to spend lots of time talking about where the money comes from WCSJ,LRTJack is calling for balance Martin agrees When there is something to dig up dig it up WCSJ,LRTJacks rebuttal we need education but we also need to be watchdogs Says we need to investigate agendas WCSJ,LRTOooh now we are going to debate this like the House of Commons No applause but hear hear and boo allowed WCSJ,LRTMartin says if you focus too much on fraud you may diminish interest in science Nothing but fraud lame sci section WCSJ,LRTMartin says in the current crisis is it feasible for many writers to go deep into every story WCSJ,LRTIf want to focus on policy makers we may focus more on money and fraud but when we write for general public it may be different WCSJ,LRTIn the changing journalism landscape do we need to get away from straight and more into journalism Andrew Jack explains more WCSJ,LRTStill feeling aftershocks He emphasized the role of media in reconstruction WCSJ he says we rise again,LRTHis group set up their newsroom under tent because they couldn go in the building WCSJ family members also with them,LRTHe walked to the office It was dangerous but we had deadline for tomorrow The building was cracked Most houses cracked WCSJ,LRTmedian age is similar to Middle East cases years old for MERS SARS is about years younger Comorbidity WCSJ,LRTthe patient went to two hospitals before arriving at the final one where history was finally taken with travel MERS WCSJ,LRTno intubation of index patient it nebulizer use MERS WCSJ,LRTwas the index patient incubated Reason for spread Also reports that Dr warned ppl warning not acted on MERS WCSJ,LRTare there SOPs for hospitals in Korea yes but need to pay more attention only compliance for hand washing MERS WCSJ,LRTArsenic also in the idea you could get used to poison all the way back to Mithridates we ve dumped that theory WCSJ,LRTSorry guys trying to live tweet but the wi fi doesn like me much WCSJ,LRTsays aresenic trioxide is the most well known poison in our murderous history WCSJ,LRTfav poison is arsenic Humans have been using it for millennia WCSJ it was

at PT ET UT,HRTNew Horizons phones home after Pluto flyby,HRTSignal was received at UT ET PT,HRTIt too long for twitter to explain exactly why that probably planted child question about the extended mission was so funny,HRTBowman We didn have any autonomy rule firings and what that means in layman terms is that teh spacecraft was happy,HRTBowman Tell your children to do what you re passionate about Do something because you want to Give yourself that challenge,HRTBowman can express how feeling to have achieved childhood dream of space exploration pretty overwhelmed at this moment,HRTThe science team starts the crowd chanting Alice name Alice Well gee,HRTStanding ovation for Alice Bowman,HRTThe next downlink we are expecting is First Look It begins at UT ET PT and

hours to get here,HRTChristy You start with Charlene and you take the ene off and put an on on,HRTAccording to Jim Christy the correct pronunciation is sharr rhymes with bar on like the word on,HRTMoore is recalling the Mariner approach images of Mars where scientists published about the km crater at Nix Olympica,HRTJeff Moore wouldn say Charon is as interesting as Pluto Not that there anything wrong with it Spencer It perfectly fine moon,HRTMuch of the geology team on New Horizons were grad students together on Voyager so they like to give each other hard time,HRTJohn Spencer This part looks like Mars if you ignore the temperature and the composition and everything else,HRTAs Grunsfeld likes to say science never sleeps aside Science would like to sleep now,HRTHere are the informal names being used for dark spots suggested by public campaign organized by,HRTguess Tweet takes the place of the traditional phone call these days,HRTAtmospheric science result,HRTCathy Olkin From the ground we knew there were lot of different colors on Pluto but we never imagined anything like this,HRTHere is the MVIC color data hope pics will make it online soon Charon pole is red,HRTThe not planets all those round worlds we ve visited to scale,HRTthink that the most dangerous possible thing to say about Pluto flyby that with it we re somehow done with the solar system We re not,HRTOh this don agree with How about the whole rest of the Kuiper belt Eris Makemake Haumea Sedna Orcus,HRTBonnie Buratti We have been monitoring from Earth what we now know is the heart on

Voyagers,HRTJust had an opportunity to congratulate Marc Buie on the quality of his pre New Horizons Hubble maps of Pluto,HRTRosetta looked at Pluto too,HRTNew Horizons best look at Pluto before close approach,HRTBowman We were seconds early Stern Our nav predicts came out to km closer to Pluto than aimpoint Well within spec PlutoFlyby,HRTRight now all images are being returned with JPEG like lossy compression We will get lossless ones eventually,HRTStern To my eye these pictures show younger surface on Pluto and much older and more battered surface on Charon PlutoFlyby,HRTGrunsfeld to Bowman What is the actual data rate think it lower than Bowman Yeah we wish it was PlutoFlyby,HRTasked if the new image showed evidence of hazes or clouds Stern replied he looked and hadn seen those or plumes yet,HRTXKCD What if What if New Horizons hit my car,HRTThere is lot of applause happening but it feels premature until we hear from New Horizons again,HRTSince it FAQ It will be hours until we hear from New Horizons because spacecraft is too busy scienceing to talk to us right now,HRTPress briefing coming up momentarily But still hours until we find out whether New Horizons survived flyby or not,HRTClosest approach PlutoFlyby,HRTThey are playing The Final Countdown,HRTThis is happening outside the press room and off NASA TV and not sure why,HRTMy first impressions of

the polar regions are compositionally very different from the dark regions,HRTStern People love turning little dots little points of light into planets and writing new textbooks from scratch,HRTGrunsfeld Pluto is capstone of our solar system exploration and also it opening up new realm,HRTStern explains color data is much more expensive in terms of bits to get it to the ground which is why more LORRI pics have come down,HRTStern We tested techniques we used to determine Pluto diameter on Charon and got the right answer radius km,HRTunderstand you have to put miles on graphics for Americans but for love of Pete why can you also put metric measurements,HRTStern We detected escaping nitrogen before expected Either escaping faster than we thought or mechanism is different than thought,HRTStern Pluto radius is km It settles the debate about the largest object in the Kuiper belt,HRTPSA will not respond to any questions comments about Pluto planetary status

well worth observing,HRTZooming in to Pluto and Charon,HRTPluto god of the underworld,HRTAn amazing and inspiring BlackAndStem scientist has died The world is poorer place tonight,HRTSince lot of people are asking they didn colorize the latest pics of Pluto because the color data they have is old thus VERY low res,HRTPluto has stopped looking like Mars and now really really looks like Titan But half the size,HRTknows how to par taaaay PlutoFlyby,HRTOMG PLUTO YOU GUYS ITS PLUTO,HRTalmost forgot My spacey shirt for today is Family Portrait by,HRTLooking good but my fingers need break

Generator inspired by DeepakChopra Did see this,HRTRead this now My column Straight talk for white men,HRTOMG can type the word plants without it coming out planets Which just happened right now too,HRTOur drought magic trick Over the past yrs we slowly replaced grass with native planets Which look better Go us notactuallystinky,HRTAnd of course years ago Eris was Xena Makemake was Easterbunny Haumea was Santa It took me long time to start using the real names,HRTHaumea was announced yrs ago yesterday fastest spinning large body in solar system Multiple moons Family of collisional fragments Wow,HRTMakemake was announced on the same day as Eris years ago Surface is covered in slabs of methane Awesome place Let go,HRTThings we ve learned If Eris had been at its closest point to the sun Clyde Tombaugh would likely have discovered it yrs ago,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs its surface reflects almost of the sunlight that hits it because of that frozen atmosphere,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs its orbit is inclined by degrees to the plane of the planets Which still doesn make sense,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has satellite Dysnomia that we think was formed in giant impact Maybe,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs it is much more massive than Pluto yet tiny bit smaller thus much rockier on the inside,HRTThings we ve learned about Eris in yrs it has very Pluto like surface composition though at the distance the atmosphere is frozen,HRThate to be the voice of Pluto sobriety or any sobriety but that whole Pluto atmosphere has collapsed in year thing smells fishy,HRTAnybody else think the two big craters on the left are from the impact of near contact binary KBO,HRTOther places likely to have cool CH flows Makemake Eris Quaoar OR Fun to see Pluto to better understand these too,HRTIn my view the ice flows are the coolest things found on Pluto so far Still want more Charon though,HRTJust interview by BBC presenter about Kepler who said look haven we more or less heard all of this before And um yeah kinda,HRTAs mentioned earlier today this is thoroughly awesome On reflection it remains awesome,HRTlove to see more of that dark terrain on Pluto THAT where we ll learn whether or not there is internal activity think Soon Ish,HRTAh Plenty of craters on Pluto where they re not covered by ices Which is of course what was expected all along,HRTHaze in the craters of Ceres OK That counts as awesome,HRTHappy to see my favorite wikipedia dwarf planet image updated so quickly,HRTOK Pluto That was fun Now back to work Today Europa Trojan asteroids And super secret project with the code name Phattie,HRTAwesomeness,HRTIt ice volcanoes all the way down,HRTthink we have winner,HRTSo what good word for frost moving around on surface to distinguish from geological activity My brain is failing to get one,HRTAlso worth noting that geologically active generally means interior rumblings Clearly frosts move around on Pluto surface,HRTMost are also hoping that Pluto is active just want better evidence If it true we ll know soon Also if not,HRTIn current hallway conversations with planetary scientists most are unconvinced by the evidence that Pluto is geologically active,HRTok hard to argue with this one,HRTSure it OK to grandfather Pluto in as planet Also you can grandfather the Earth as flat too if that makes you feel better,HRTll be there at the Planetary Society thing tonight listening for the NH signal Come say hi Throw ice or something,HRTIf you re local amp looking for place to geek out on Pluto tonight come to the Planetary Society event in Pasadena,HRTEvery time someone says Pluto looks really interesting thus should be planet Titan sheds an alkane tear,HRTOr maybe not Figuring out if that is plausible requires getting out the pencil and doing calculations Which too sleepy to do now,HRTequatorial ice melting decades earlier Once it starts it spreads around the equator Leaving the heart for last,HRTIs it coincidence that the heart is on the anti Charon side Maybe light from Charon provided just enough extra heat to start the,HRTMy best is that if you came back in years the heart would be gone which sounds kind of sad and dark regions would extend further,HRTBUT the bright patch really shouldnt be at the equator That one of the warmest spots The rest of the equator is ice free as expected,HRTNot surprising to have ice patches coming and going Pluto goes through seasonal temperature extremes so that is expected,HRTThat heart on Pluto sure is odd It appears to be thick ice patch that is being slowing eaten away at the edges,HRTAlso the dark patch at Charon north pole definitely looks more interesting than initially gave it credit for,HRTWatch Charon probably the most similar thing in the solar system to Orcus at least on the surface,HRTOhhh crater rays on Charon Awesome And might the tiny white splotches be my ice volcanoes want ice volcanoes,HRTUseful to keep in mind Pluto size and density in the context of other objects from the Kuiper belt,HRTHey so is it too early to suggest that the big heart on Pluto whatever it turns out to be be named Tombaugh,HRTBack in offered these thoughts on the critical question of whether Eris or Pluto is bigger on,HRTOdd that Eris is tiny bit smaller than Pluto but so much more massive They are quite different bodies in many ways Maybe we should go,HRTgood sign would be that Charon pole is not just darker but also red think we ll get color info soon,HRTPluto still pretty inscrutable at this distance More resolution please oh you will thanks,HRTendorse,HRTmonth ago suggested Charon would look like Uranus moon Ariel Similarities pretty good so far,HRTWe re approaching the summer solstice after which most of the northern ices might have headed south Process already starting now,HRTIn the fig the solid line shows the latitude of the sun time the dark regions show where the ice has evaporated white is ice,HRTHere figure from that Hansen amp Paige paper showing how Pluto surface ices move around with time,HRTEven now that about all can say Amazing how fast this is all going to come and go and how much we will wish we saw but didn,HRTOn Charon the brightest spots are likely to be ammonia rich water ice flows Dark spots not dark just lack of water flows,HRTOK what about Charon Still too low detail want craters damnit And want them now But will have to wait,HRTConclusions even at this range it is really really hard to learn details of what is going on here Recommendation Go closer,HRTof that sort Your eye is good at playing tricks on you suspect that on the nicely imaged side you ll see no giant polygons,HRTWhat are the polygonal features Not polygons Seems unlikely any physical process could form large scale linear features cont,HRTevaporating and going poleward Come back in years and it might look just like the equator Again nicely modeled in Hansen amp Paige,HRTNorth of the dark equator are the patchy tropics Summer has started here recently so suspect this is where ice is currently cont,HRTThe heart could just be random feedback It bright so reflects sunlight so cold so gets icy gets brighter gets colder etc,HRTWhy is the dark equatorial band not continuous No clue The heart looks like the brightest spot on the surface and its equatorial,HRTdark substrate behind Dark substrate is probably tholins Tholins organic muck sorry,HRTby Hansen and Paige who showed how nitrogen evaporates from the warm equatorial regions and reaccumulates at the poles leaving cont,HRTThe dominant feature on Pluto is the dark but not quite continuous equatorial band This was nicely explained in in paper cont,HRTOK friends the Pluto and Charon images are good enough for new round of speculation Let start here,HRTThe latest Pluto images remind me of early adaptive optics images of Titan totally cool and thoroughly uninterpretable Soon though Soon,HRTJust back from vacation What all of this Pluto stuff everyone is talking about,HRTBiggest Pluto surprise to me so far is that New Horizons still hasn spotted any new moons have bet yes,HRTso far nothing on pluto Charon to be surprised about But images are quickly getting better Stay tuned,HRTCharon looks grayer because it too small to keep nitrogen or methane from escaping so only has old water ice on its surface,HRTpeach relatively fresh methane starting to degrade Dark old warm ice free degraded methane,HRTon Pluto darker spots get warmer drove off ices get warmer still drive off more ices etc etc So white cold nitrogen ice,HRTmethane breaks apart and turns reddish when exposed to sunlight and space Pluto is patchy probably because of feedback,HRTTime for your periodic Pluto speculations So far all is as expected Pluto is peach colored because of methane,HRTHappy AsteroidDay day on which you should ponder just how full of crap the people are who are trying to scare you about asteroids,HRTPluto likely mottled because of surface feedback slightly darker areas get warmer drive off ices get darker get warmer get darker,HRTWhy is Pluto so mottled looking Deconvolution will make it appear more so than it really is but we know that it really IS,HRTWhere do ice flows on Charon come from The ancient interior ocean now frozen out but once erupting onto the surface,HRTDark polar cap on Charon Unlikely to be dark ice frost cap but rather lack of bright stuff What is bright stuff Ice flows,HRTPro tip for New Horizons images of Pluto amp Charon be wary of sharpened and deconvolved images Don believe stuff unless in raw ones,HRTQuaoar Named after the Tongva tribe creation deity who sang and danced the world into existence lt Quaoar,HRTIn case you were worried actually like the real non planet Pluto,HRTICYMI my speculations yesterday on the latest Pluto images have been Storyfyed,HRTTruth is more excited to see Charon suspect it will look something like this,HRTFirst step read little of what we think is on Pluto Even in we had some ideas start around Figure,HRTnot involved in New Horizons so am free to do purely speculative geological interpretaiton starting NOW,HRTAs of today the silly term Plutoid has been used in precisely zero titles or abstracts of refereed papers,HRTHold still Europa You re being analyzed this won hurt bit,HRTDear Europa we are about to spy on you We will learn your secrets We are like the NSA of the Jupiter system xoxoxo,HRTNASA might go to Europa within the next decade Me amp the Keck telescope are going there in about hours,HRTEvery time someone says dwarf planet must be planet because of the name seahorse somewhere sheds salty tear,HRTAnother view The iron is almost mirror like Olive deep green translucent This one was gift from my class,HRTMy fav thinly sliced pallasite translucent olivine Hard to photograph,HRTBeautiful Widmanstatten pattern in this iron meteorite Pattern only forms in frozen cores of mini worlds,HRTThe core mantle boundary of shattered mini world Thanks mini world Sorry about the shattering pallasite,HRTIt chondrules all the way down AKA tiny chunk from the birth of the solar system,HRTThis is an awesome Fukang pallasite Huge olivine crystals,HRTThis No big deal it just PIECE OF THE MOON,HRTNeed to record new SciSolSys lecture today because that damned keeps finding new things on Mars Stop it already,HRTAlso everyone loves those really bright spots on Ceres think these are little more intriguing,HRTOK so the white spots on Ceres are dramatic and mysterious but check out all of those near global scale ridges too,HRTOur biggest sweetest orangest cat has passed Our home is sadder and emptier Also less orange So long Ike,HRTBut the estimate was still wrong The real mass of Pluto is only th of the Earth,HRTzong just found this thing that helps you stay awake at night its called coffee my friends and ill sell you some for one zillion dollars,HRTIt been interesting being here on the big Island listening to people about Mauna Kea The NYT is nicely balanced,HRTOne hour until sunset on Mauna Kea Then we ll open up the Keck telescope and begin to understand the solar system little bit better,HRTNice byproduct of observing Europa with Keck is this sweet little image of Jupiter in the guide camera,HRTAMA on Reddit minutes,HRTdoing Reddit AMA on Saturday So you can ask me anything Really Anything at all Wide open Just not about Pluto OK Deal Promise,HRThave theory that using ice from the dark trailing side of Europa would result in the best gin amp tonic ever like to test that idea,HRTThis sounds like it might be really good deal to me Wonder if it ever goes on sale though,HRTLilah was doing tessellations in math today and was all like let me introduce you to Escher and she was all like head explodes,HRTThis Pluto musical almost makes me feel sad for Pluto But Nahhhhhh,HRTGalileo hacked my data Claimed credit,HRTMars is now dead to me just finished recording all of my Mars lectures so have no more to do Mars is actually dead to me,HRTJust submitted telescope proposal with title search for planets in the distant solar system Don tell anyone though it secret,HRTLilah Sigh miss kindergarten Me What part It was just fun weary sigh How come no one told me it was the best time of life,HRTAnyone wonder why all of those bright dwarf planets were discovered yrs ago and nothing much since explain,HRTyrs ago today we discovered Makemake the nd brightest KBO after Pluto It was unsurprisingly nicknamed Easterbunny for awhile,HRTMy free online Science of the Solar System has now begun Students from every continent except Antarctica Anyone there like planets,HRTInterested in Science of the Solar System class but logging in to Coursera is too much work Check out the intro here,HRTMy free online class Science of the Solar System is now LIVE on Courera SciSolSys,HRTWhat The sneak preview to Science of the Solar System drops tomorrow You never heard it from me,HRTlike life on an ocean plate PacificPlateRules NorthAmrericanPlateDrools,HRTHere are your spooky alien jellyfish for the day You re welcome,HRTDwarf planet Quaoar is named for the creation deity of the Tongva tribe asked their permission first They named the moon Weywot,HRTMauna Kea full of snow But the skies are clear the sun is setting and we re off to discover things,HRTMy mother is in Iceland this week on aurora photography trip So she took this picture Nice timing mom,HRTGoal tomorrow night Discover new never before seen members of the Kuiper belt Then kill them Wait No That not it,HRTHere the talk summary Ceres is weird So Bethany Ehlmann and pointed telescope at it Which showed that Ceres is weird Seriously,HRTOnly weeks until the start of my free online Science of the Solar System MOOC,HRTMikebrown is eccentric oddly inclined and not very bright The asteroid mean Mikebrown Also capable of destroying humanity,HRTOn Titan it only seems to rain hard couple of times decade Which makes it like California only colder And with methane,HRTToo sleepy to tweet it last night but as seen from Keck Titan weather report Yesterday partly cloudy little chance of methane rain,HRTEuropa question for tonight where exactly is all of that hydrogen peroxide coming from We might know the answer in about an hour,HRTdon wanna jinx myself or anything but we found tiny tiny hole in the fog and clouds and are looking at Europa with Keck RIGHT NOW,HRTMe on Ceres The images now are just at that intriguing resolution that lets you make stuff up,HRTCeres and Pluto may become planets again soon Also this just in pigs soon to fly and something about monkeys too,HRTSo this morning she asked me if each baby is different and had the dad genes and the mom how do you get identical twins,HRTMe It just little like kissing OH That totally makes sense Now tell me more about cells and genes and how they work FTW,HRTout of boys genes out of girls but how do the boy and girl cells get together so that they can share,HRTLilah just now How do you make babies Me Boys amp girls have cells designed to merge and share the genes together and baby grows,HRTAnd because know you want to know here is the real Sci of the Solar Sys course page With fun preview video,HRTNot bragging or anything yes yes am but SciSolSys is the top rated physical science MOOC IN THE KNOWN UNIVERSE,HRTHey In weeks my free online Science of the Solar System class starts again Last year reviews SciSolSys,HRTBecause everyone sitting next to me on airplanes always asks the Economist explains well why Pluto isn planet,HRTyears ago today the st object in the Kuiper belt was found We mistakenly thought it planet at st but now know its more interesting,HRTValentine dinner Nerd style Oysters in liquid nitrogen,HRTRoses are red Violets are blue Which means got the wrong flowers again Damnit,HRTRoses are red Violets are blue Which is weird cause Shouldn they be violet right,HRTOpening the dome at Palomar Skies are clear Trying to be quiet so as not to spook the whales on Europa,HRTAlso Mars shares beer yayMars,HRTIf Mars images look blurry tomorrow its because most of the Curiosity team is
