You just have to work together. Eg. @ISS_Research #ssf15The cost of getting 1.5 kgs into space costs somewhere between $70-100k. That's the cost for only 1.5L of water! #ssf15MP: who here would make a one-way trip to Mars?  *about two hands go up"  MP: That's INCREDIBLE #ssf15The school kids in the audience seem very  very keen on this idea. #ssf15Also  the whole eviction thing... But MP solves this problem by saying the winners get to go home. Losers stay in space. #ssf15Biggest problem for space travel is cost. So  the Big Brother Space Travel idea solves that with reality TV funding.  Seriously.  #ssf15MP has a plan to get herself into space. This plan is basically...

I think @ABCmediawatch is actually having a go at me tonight. #askdrkarl #sydsciencefestDK: Some people in Med got jealous  some people didn't care  but basically it's just a different field #askdrkarl #sydsciencefestQ: "When you started getting into the media  how did medical colleagues react?" #askdrkarl #sydsciencefestDK: And then if you do  stick to the facts and don't get angry. #askdrkarl #sydsciencefestDK: The easiest way out is  you should consider getting into politics.  The only way you can have power in this  is to become a politicianAudience member: "How are we going to change the action/lackthereof on climate change in time?" #askdrkarl #sydsciencefestDK: Time is real  and it exists by itself.  Our version of time is a construct #sydsciencefestNext Q  the arrow of time!  What's up with that? #askdrkarl #sydsciencefestDK: The fundamental problem is that we do not see  like some other societies do  education as an investment in the future  #sydsciencefestDK: It rests with the teachers.  To get into science  you do need to get through the difficult stuff  but it doesn't have to be boringFirst Q  "How can we communicate science effectively without 'dumbing' it down?" #askdrkarl #sydsciencefestAnd now it is question time.

Do we have free-will  asks @DoctorKarl #ssf15 #askdrkarlOne exception  DK says  is that sometimes it is possible to bring forth abilities we didn't know we had access to. #ssf15 #askdrkarlDK: Technically  not all at the same time. But over a day  you will use every part of an organ. #ssf15 #askdrkarlDK: You make use of 100% of every organ you have #ssf15 #askdrkarl@RoseReadMobile @mobilemuster1 @sydsciencefest yes  I'm strangely drawn to this one  too. Once you're a wastie you're always a wastie!DK: After a few more culprits on this myth  the "10% fact" was born #ssf15 #askdrkarlDK: It was James who started this whole thing by saying that we "are not making use of our mental abilities" #ssf15 #askdrkarl@DoctorKarl: debunking via film Lucy our ability to use only 10% brain capacity #sydsciencefest #askdrkarlDK: This starts off kind of with William James  a painter. #ssf15 #askdrkarlDK using the film 'Lucy' as the example which is based on this premise #ssf15 #askdrkarl.@DoctorKarl onto the commonly spread "fact" that we only use 10% of our brains #ssf15 #askdrkarl@DoctorKarl teaching us about the science of alcohol at #sydsciencefest http://t.co/2pejuRTMIj@DoctorKarl: our society drenched in Alcohol but we don't know how to use it (scientifically speaking) #sydsciencefest #askdrkarl@GeologySocAust and @UNSW are proud to deliver the 2015 #gsapublicforum during @SydScienceFest @UNSWScience http://t.co/ZWjQrxKrgN"The act of going through a doorway changes your perception of threats in a different environment" #ssf15doctorkarl talking probs w/ human body ( remedies!) @phmuseum for @sydsciencefest #sydsciencefestâ€¦ https://t.co/PjETZb3rONDK: Why do doorways make you forget things?  Again  an evolutionary trait. #ssf15Spoiler  it's because of doorways. #ssf15Moving onto memory.  Ever have that feeling when you walk into another room and forget something? #ssf15DK: So everything you see is a combo of the true colour  the shade  comparisons - all evolved traits #ssf15Part 3: Colour constancy.  This is an evolutionary trait so that we can tell what things look like in both the light and dark #ssf15DK: Have you ever tried to guess an absolute weight?  You just can't really.  We are better at relative guesses #ssf15Part 1: The dress is blue.  Just check the pixels. Part 2: Senses are good at relative measurements but bad at absolute ones. #ssf15DK: There's a 6 part answer to this conundrum actually  and in the end is just a clever example of a colour illusion #ssf15Quick check with the audience on what they think  and then DK launches into the history of the #thedressDK?

And you know who we need to help us? Chemists.  #sydsciencefest.@all_isee: Well  despite all this evolving  parasites can still take over your body in an instant #sydsciencefestDC: We've made cooking  cultures  all things.

Our bodies have the same coverage as apes  its just fair and thin #sydsciencefestGrand Final is DC (humans) and @all_isee for chemistry! #sydsciencefest.@AWaardenberg's argument against population control is basically lets just go see what other planets we can screw up #sydsciencefest.@phatmattbaker with his rhyming debate for population control #sydsciencefest http://t.co/Q5WBusSwed.@josiendebie arguing in that previous round! #sydsciencefest http://t.co/zRt25OcyF3(Random topic round) global population control. @phatmattbaker is positive who is arguing in rhyming prose... #sydsciencefestJB: Which means Med needs to focus less on humans being a male default in medical research and start studying differences #sydsciencefestJB: We study all these animals for telomeres and cancer  except women live longer and don't get some diseases. #sydsciencefestJB: The issue I have with humans is that the default is a man. Women have been around for a while too though #sydsciencefestDC: Eg. Sex in other animals is a purely evolutionary act. But humans love it! #sydsciencefestDC up now against @josiendebie.

Self-cleaning surfaces  better velcro. #sydsciencefest.@ad_mico now.  Going for the route of Chemistry being PC and Nanotech being Mac.  Nanotech is cool according to AM. #sydsciencefestAW: So if nanotech takes over the world  the chemists will help us #sydsciencefestAW: Obvs meth is a very destructive drug  but the show also covered an awesome aspect of Chem - cancer treatment #sydsciencefestAW: Chemistry has also given us the best TV show ever made; Breaking Bad.  #faircall #sydsciencefestOOoo  AW is also taking the route of engulfing the opponent's field into their own.

Alcohol is great  in moderation ofc #sydsciencefestLS: And a supernova is an explosion.  Also the Big bang.  All important explosions.  Astronomy creates some good explosions  #sydsciencefestLS up first. 'I want to convince you my research rules.
